There were a few people in line, and I handed the key over to the front desk lady, who told me everything was fine. No problems, no mention of being late or anything like that.\n\nNow, I’ve been hit with a $650 charge in my account, claiming I didn’t return the key on time. To make matters worse, they’re saying that if I don’t pay, this will be passed on to a debt collection agency or their lawyer, and they might take legal action against me. I don’t understand how this is happening when I know I returned the key on time and was told by the staff everything was okay.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with anything like this? Is there any way to fight this, or am I stuck paying for something that isn’t even my fault?

I know the pay is good, trust i was feeling it as just an intern, but the work felt dull and stressful at the same time (somehow) and i started dreading coming to work by week 3. I WAS someone who used to say i would do anything for a multi six fig paycheck, but atp, I would take 90-100k and a calmer job than a 150k+ software job thats gonna drive me up the wall.\n\nSo, please give me some ideas by telling me your stories!

However, I won't consider myself as a stellar student - unlike most of other grad students, I don't have a perfect 4.0 GPA (I have one C in my transcript, but my GPA is greater than 3.5) and am also withdrawing from a course this semester. Before withdrawing this semester though - I wanted to ask how much it would hurt me to do that, considering I'm applying for Phds? As transcripts matter more in Phd applications as compared to the industry. Any other people who had similar experiences?\n\nI do have some research experience (been taking special problems, and I'm also currently a GRA). I've heard that this experience matters more, but I am still worried about my transcript.

1g8ejsh	Legoman_win1	2024-10-21 01:36:23	9	5	Hey GT students, I'm a pathway student looking to transfer next year for computer engineering. Long story short, I went to an international IB school and rawdogged the exams, but still managed to get credits at my school right now for physics 1 and 2. (Kinda strange since IB physics wasn't calc based and just went into more in-depth topics.) But this means when I transfer I would also get to skip phys 1 and 2 at GT.\n\nHowever, my main concern is that my foundation in physics feels a bit shaky. Is it worth retaking these courses? I'm considering using winter break or summer break to refresh and relearn the material instead. Also, I'd like to know what the key areas of physics are for computer engineering at GT.\n\nThanks for reading, would appreciate any helpful feedback!

I was reaching out for advice/opinions on the transfer housing. I’m unsure on whether to room on-campus or off? I have close friends at Tech and some other close friends who are also transferring through pathways but there’s very little info on housing for transfers. Are the dorms nice? Will I even be able to get housing on-campus since pathway students get decisions in June?\n\nAnd if you preferred off-campus housing- where are the best places to live, preferably places that charge per unit and not by person but I’m open to the idea!\n\nThanks in advance	Transfer Housing opinions/advice	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1g6ti4o/transfer_housing_opinionsadvice/	/r/gatech/comments/1g6ti4o/transfer_housing_opinionsadvice/	0	Question	0	0	0

The first exam has already happened and I didn’t do too hot on the exam. When I checked course critique, her avg GPA was very high compared to all the other Biochemistry 2 professors, but Im confused as to how this is possible if her exams are so difficult. She has only taught one class before (Spring 23’), and I’m wondering if anyone has taken her class and if you could give any tips or insight on how to do better! I’ve been going through all the PowerPoints, and I’m planning on reading the textbook to clear up some things, but the information can be so confusing that I keep getting lost. \n\nAlso, in general, even if it's not specific to Das, any advice for Biochem 2 would be great!!!

1g4ms9b	Minimonyet	2024-10-16 00:29:14	13	24	Hello! I’m a transfer student who just came from a local college in Georgia. Im studying ISYE right now, but I’m getting hung up on some of the math courses (Discrete in particular is killing me). I know that ISYE is comparably easy when compared to other Engineering majors, but I’m not sure I want to pursue something like that (I could make it through, but it wouldn’t be pretty for my GPA).\n\nRight now, I’m considering a few options:\n\n\n1. Thug it out with ISYE. The problems with this are self-evident. I’m not very good at mathematical thinking and I just don’t think I have the mind for it like my peers do.\n\n2. Do some sort of LMC or Econ degree. I loved Econ and Communications in high school and I’m told that it isn’t a bad program. I know there’s lots of stats stuff but I haven’t done that yet to know if I’ll hate it. This is the choice I lean most towards at the moment.\n\n3. Do business. This one is a pretty clear choice, but honestly, I don’t think I’d like business from a more ethical standpoint. It’s an undergrad degree, so it doesn’t matter much, but I feel like I could choose a different degree and probably be fine? I’m not sure.\n\nThank you all for your input. I know that it’s an undergrad degree, so I feel confident in saying that once I land the first few internships or jobs, I’ll be okay, but this decision has been eating me up for a while now.\n\nI hope you all have a great day!

Phys 2211 is moving their exam to next week which, ironically enough, is gonna give me issues with voting (I booked flights to go home mid Nov 4th to vote in person Nov 5th, so now i gotta figure out if there are any flights i can move mine to).\n\nI don't blame the profs for moving it, logically it makes the most sense to move it since it would impact all the profs and off-campus students, but i am still upset at GT's lateness in the whole thing.

I'm not really enjoying my time on campus (hate city life) and I feel like I would be happier if I just commuted. The drive is around 35 to 45 (heavy traffic) minutes, and my expenses would be minimal with only having to pay for a parking pass. If I do, I would plan to have my earliest classes later in the day, so realistically speaking I would be on campus from noon to 6pm with a light schedule. Depending on my schedule, I'd try to beat out rush hour traffic so I'd only spend an hour a day on the road. Also I'm not worried about the social impacts because I don't really have much of a social life on campus.\n\n  \nWondering if anyone has commuted or is currently and what your experiences are?

There are practically no spots left for this parking permit as a result. When I purchased my permit there was NO warning and NO care to allow us to switch to other lots--and now I have been paying the price the whole year. They seem very overzealous to ticket and tow me over accidentally parking in "RSER51" which I thought indicated it was ONLY for ER51 patrons. Apparently this code means it's a reserved spot--so my $800 that I worked for to pay for my spot means nothing even with the code for ER51. Poor signage and  low effort to contact the owners of these vehicles is costing us. Not only that but I have had at least 18 days where I cannot park in my lot due to games or other events. I am extremely frustrated; I use my car to get to work, I don't just have it on campus for shits and giggles. I really wish there was more done about this.

The canvas peer review system was perfectly fine. The most frustrating part is posting my submission on ed discussion as proof that I wasn't late and then sending a regrade request because the peer review system didn't work even after they pushed the deadline back. ALSO why is the deadline on perusall in ANOTHER TIME ZONE... straw on the camel's back. No way the TA's are any less frustrated than we are. \n\nI missed Dana White's Contender Series fumbling with perusall for 2 hours until giving up and posting on ed discussion.\n\nchama	PHYS 2212 Lab Submissions (Perusall & EdDiscussion)	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fzhyyl/phys_2212_lab_submissions_perusall_eddiscussion/	/r/gatech/comments/1fzhyyl/phys_2212_lab_submissions_perusall_eddiscussion/	-1	Rant	-36	-36	-1

1fz6hag	kreamkay	2024-10-08 18:11:00	22	46	Hello,\nI am a transfer student and I just started my first “real” semester and I feel like I’m really struggling. I’m a cs major and I finished my first semester at tech over summer 2024. It wasn’t bad, it was 9 credit hours, all online, and I ended with a 3.0. This semester I’m taking 12 hours and half my classes are not bad at all but my cs classes (1332 & 2340) are really putting a strain on my mental. I feel like I’m really behind everyone else here, especially in 2340 as most of my group members seem to have more experience with just about everything than I do. The material has been a lot more difficult to follow in 1332 since the first exam that I got an 80 on as well. I spent a long time trying to get into tech and I always thought I wanted to do cs but I’ve recently been considering switching my major. I just wanted to ask for advice from older cs students as to whether this is normal for new gt students or if I should genuinely reconsider what I want to do at this point.

1gbhyob	Zealousideal_Move124	2024-10-25 00:42:22	13	8	I am newer to Tech because I transfered here this year. I am someone who is good with turning in work and getting a good grade, however, I have always done poorly on exams. My old college work well with that method but what I have noticed from attending Gatech is that more classes focus on exam grades and not the course work. I have a 2 credit Linear Algebra I am taking right now and I have a 60% because I bombed the first 2 exams.\n\nI would need (at most) a 60% on the last midterm and an 80% on the final to pass with a 70%. The final will be a higher weight then and my lowest midterm weight would go down too.\n\nI plan to immediately start practicing all the older exams for my next midterm and try to learn about exam concepts. There are multiple practice exams for each exam. I also plan to utilize office hours for TA and the Professor.  I have a disability that effects my cognitive function, so storing information in my brain is harder, hence why I tend to be worse at exams than the HW.\n\nI have been in this situation before yet was able to pass however that was at another college.\n\nI am just looking for advice because I do not have anyone to talk to, but the decision date is coming up.\n\n  \nEdit: Additionally, I am having outside stressors that I have approached the appropriate people about and my professors were informed. Unfortunately, that is more for late work (which i dont really have) and not exams	I rely too much on homework and not exams, should I drop class?	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1gbhyob/i_rely_too_much_on_homework_and_not_exams_should/	/r/gatech/comments/1gbhyob/i_rely_too_much_on_homework_and_not_exams_should/	0	Question	0	0	0

1fxu59p	jimins_wap	2024-10-06 23:38:47	46	76	Hey everyone! I’m a first year at Tech (this is my first semester) and I just wanted to come on here and rant about some frustrations since coming here.\n\nI never thought I would end up at Tech because truly I applied on the whim. However the school I wanted to go to didn’t really work out especially cost wise. So here I am at the next best option. But to cut costs I’m commuting and the travel time is around an hour with traffic. I have classes 5 days a week (most of which are 8:00 ams) so not only do I have to get up 2 hours earlier than most people but I also get home later which really sets me back when it comes to doing homework or studying, because by the time I get home I just want to rest.\n\nI have been doing my assignments on time however I don’t feel like I’m learning anything. It feels as if I’m doing the work just to do the work. And it’s not that I don’t want to learn, but it’s that everyday there is a new topic and I don’t have the time or the mental capacity to truly retain much of it especially when I’m taking 15+ credits this semester. It’s like during the class I’ll understand, but right after it’ll just leave my mind because now I have to focus on another subject. But when I get back to the previous subject, we’re already learning a new topic. I just feel like I can’t yk? Like I just can’t. I’ve thrived on academic validation my whole life, so seeing how I’m struggling with my classes hurts me as a person. I want to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA for my scholarship but at this rate it’s just so hard.\n\nI’ve went to tutoring, I’ve went to office hours, I’ve went to recitations, and I’ve even done study groups. But barely have they helped. I even have regular appointments at the mental health resource center. But it has truly taken such a toll on my emotional and mental state because in all honestly I feel stupid and dumb being at tech and just so behind everyone else. Everyone seems like they know what they’re doing and what they want to be in life and here I am just stuck. \n\nI’m so tired and burnt out man like what can I do?? Seriously. I have no motivation, I feel burnt out and like my brain is fried, and every Sunday is like hell cause i know what the week holds.\n\nI really feel like not many people actually come out and say how bad they’re struggling. So here I am actually saying I am STRUGGLING. Any advice? Or if anyone can relate please or have been through this, please tell me how you managed. And if anyone wants to be my mentor or something, please let me know cause I could really use one.

How difficult are the major related classes compared to core classes? Particularly the math that is taught? Now I know that its tech and its engineering so thats pretty much straightforward but because its considered the "easiest" engineering major, does the math completely bend one over or is it manageable? What math skill does probability and statistics heavily rely on?\n2. I heard to get into many of the major related classes, it would take around 1-2 years to finish all the prerequisites. Would it put me behind if i started to take major related classes junior year? Do the classes get filled really quick?\n3. How are the professors and the learning environment?

I bombed the first exam and even when i seem to understand what the professor is saying i just can’t retain anything and am having trouble contributing in the GPS. I’ve been wanting to go to office hours but I just feel like i’m so behind on material i don’t even know where to start and the next midterm is 10/28. If i were to withdraw the course and take it online over the summer would it put me immensely behind? i’m also taking calc 2 rn. i didn’t come in with a lot of credits so i’ve always known i was going to have to take summer classes but I really wanted to get an internship this summer.

I've also already taken all my gen ed courses and only have BME courses left.\n\nIf I can't go abroad during the summer what do you suggest I do to study abroad at least once before I graduate?

1fuwrzf	jammish-	2024-10-03 01:44:30	27	38	So I'm a 4th year EnvE + ALIS major (and CHIN minor) and my original graduation date was fall 2025. I got this internship offer in the spring and I'm really excited, but it's going to push my graduation date to spring 2026. I mean, there's nothing wrong with graduating spring 2026, but I feel like I need to "get in the work force" as fast as possible. I talked to both my ALIS and EnvE advisors and they were both basically like "nope not at all," but I still am delusional thinking I may be able to pull it off.\n\nThe thing is: I have 12 classes left (4 KOR, 8 CEE)...Here was my plan for the spring:\n\n- KOR 4002 (I talked with the professor beforehand and can do the class online)\n\n- VIP (any VIP class, but just for 1 credit b/c I've taken a VIP class before for 2 credits)\n\n- ECON 2105 (there was a section that was async this semester so I'm just praying there is an async one next semester)\n\n- I was thinking of doing CEE research as well...\n\nI was thinking I could take 4 classes over the summer, but higher level CEE classes aren't usually offered over the summer, same thing with Korean.\n\nI know this sounds like super duper crazy and like out of it, but idk...I already feel bad about the possibility of me being a full on fifth year. I heard Cabrera speak yesterday saying "oh yeah, we're not the best with 4 year graduation rate, we need to work on that" as if it's the student's fault.\n\nShould I just accept defeat and plan to graduate spring 2026? Or is there a slim chance I can pull this off and graduate a semester early?

Granted I went to a pretty consistently ranked top 5 in dining for undergrad, but North Ave straight up needs a deep cleaning.

Like, they aren't even connected—literally, not a single one in the building works.\n* A bike storage room that you can’t get into unless you hunt down a security guard or employee to get a physical key.\n* The rudest security guard I’ve ever met (the bald guy who works weekends, iykyk).\n* Maintenance that gaslights you into believing your broken appliances are fine, even when they’re clearly malfunctioning. (My dishwasher had a huge puddle of water underneath, and they refused to fix it. I had to replace the seals myself just to wash my dishes).\n* A garage gate that’s stuck open, meaning anyone can park in the “resident-only” lot.\n* And today, we found out we’re down to just one working elevator for the entire building — all 19 floors. Anyone who's been to U-House in the last few weeks knows we’ve already been down one elevator, which they said would take over 4 weeks to fix.\n\nThe first screenshot is from the email I got today, the second is from a few days ago. Note that our B4 elevator has been out since the beginning of this month, and we only have 4 — I also don't think that they’ve fixed any elevator faster than a week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sr0arhn350qd1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d5138581d9bc5266034669715e2dfb958d3e3a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ik0aqdn350qd1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb9055ea76c45c2ea4e334e6e21fe5a2e60468f\n\nI absolutely love my apartment, both the place itself and it’s proximity to campus/midtown — but living somewhere where it regularly takes over 20 minutes to get an elevator (and I live on one of the higher floors, so 15+ flights of stairs isn’t really an option) always puts both myself and my guests in a terrible mood.\n\nNeedless to say, unless they turn it around soon, I’m not renewing my lease for next year — and neither should you.

1fsxchj	cowrider350	2024-09-30 14:48:29	22	149	I think many of us were excited to see that diagonal crossing was being implemented at one of the most dangerous intersections we have here on campus, and it was great for the first couple days while it was set to have one car cycle for every pedestrian cycle.\n\nSuper disappointed that it is now 3-4 car cycles per pedestrian cycle. We don’t have time to wait five minutes to cross one street. Now people are forced to either jaywalk the intersection, or stand there forever, which makes it less safe than what we had before. Imo it’s one step forward, but two steps back for pedestrian walkability on campus.

1ffedkj	DJdirtycube	2024-09-12 21:46:34	32	250	**TL;DR:** Just a Chinese crybaby who got admitted to Georgia Tech Shenzhen for Spring 2025, but now the program is being shut down for prospective students. Gave up other opportunities, missed job recruiting, and now I'm stuck wondering what to do next.\n\nHi, everyone.\n\nThis isn't a post against GT's decision—just me sharing my story. I’m just a random Chinese student who was accepted into Georgia Tech’s Spring 2025 MSCS program in Shenzhen. [You may have heard about the decision to end Georgia Tech Shenzhen Institute (GTSI).](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fb6kc4/georgia_tech_to_exit_georgia_tech_shenzhen/) Whether you agree with it or not, it’s drastically changed my life.\n\nThree of my four undergraduate years were spent under Xi Jinping’s strict zero-COVID policy, forcing me to rely on poor online classes. I took control of my learning by using free resources from U.S. universities, which led to the idea of studying abroad. Then I found GT Shenzhen—the only U.S. program I could afford. I gave up job hunting and a guaranteed spot in a Chinese grad program to focus on my application. Despite missing the 2024 fall deadline, I was admitted for Spring 2025.\n\nAnd now, it’s all likely to be taken away.\n\nI have to admit, I chose GT Shenzhen not just for its education and cost but because GT's reputation could make me more competitive in the global job market, giving me hope of finding a job overseas and escaping China. I understand GT’s decision—the risks of collaborating with China are high. I also don’t want to see a future where dictators like Xi Jinping, Putin, and Kim Jong-un gain more power. In fact, I’ve tried as much as I can to offer proxy services (a.k,a VPN) to my friends and classmates, because I believe that free access to information should be a fundamental right for everyone and I hope they can realize how evil these assholes are. So if I were an American, I would probably support this decision 100%.\n\nNow, because of GT Shenzhen’s closure, I’m an unemployed man who missed the job window and doesn’t know what’s next. Just days ago, I was excited about choosing between GIOS and HCI as my first course. I wish GT will provide some other options to pursue my degree.\n\nIn the end, no matter how things turn out for me, I still to hope for a world that’s better and more open for everyone.\n\n**FYI:** GTSI is currently working on a teach-out plan for existing students, but since there are only a handful of us admitted for Spring 2025, the most cost-effective solution seems to be rescinding our admissions. I don’t blame them; I’m just worried about my future.

1fximji	namik2015	2024-10-06 15:09:01	11	38	Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a student who just returned to Tech this semester after going through the readmission process. Unfortunately, things have been really rough since the start. Literally a day before the semester began, some unexpected issues with my housing came up, and I ended up having to live in my car for the first six weeks of the semester. While my housing situation has stabilized now, my commute is about 40 minutes each way (without traffic), which is still adding a lot of stress.\n\nAll of this combined has put me in a constant game of catch-up. I’m barely finishing homework on time, and when midterms came around, I had to choose between studying or completing assignments. I’ve been trying really hard to hold everything together, but I feel like I’m slowly losing my grip.\n\nMy grades have been slipping, and I’ve had the worst midterm performances of my academic career so far (I got a 51, 70, 73, 70, and 87). I feel like I’m in a hole that’s getting deeper at a rate of 3x, and I can only climb out at 2x. I’m really starting to lose hope and can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nIs there anything I can do to maybe buy myself some time, or any steps I can take to get back on track? Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks.

1fp8f6j	bx410	2024-09-25 16:17:02	15	62	If you are a student at Georgia Tech (and a US citizen, not a fellon, etc) you have the legal right to vote in Georgia, regardless if you are in or out of state! I am originally from New Jersey but I registered to vote with only my Buzzcard. Its pretty easy! Please register to vote before the deadline of **Oct 7,2024!**\n\n**If you're out of state and not from a swing state**, please consider registering to vote in Georgia because its status as a swing state gives its voters more voting power over the election. By registering to vote in Georgia, **you are forfeiting your right to vote in your previous state.**\n\nHere's how I did it:\n\n1. **I went to the** [Fulton County Voter Registration office in person](https://g.co/kgs/ZGdQDQi). The staff told me they prefer people register in person because it takes them a while to process mail-in registration forms, also trying to print out the mail in form was weird cause the formatting wont work with a normal US letter size paper.\n2. **I** [**took MARTA from Midtown to Five Points**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AJ7RdoHnwGJY5DEr5) and walked 5 mins to the voter registration office. (You can just take the Gold bus to MARTA Midtown Station!)\n3. I filled out a form in the office. It takes 2 mins to do.\n4. **I presented my Buzzcard, and provided last 4 digits of my SSN.** This is all they need. You DO NOT need to provide proof of address or a GA drivers license! \n5. **I checked my voter registration status afterward.** It takes 24-48 hours during business days to process your application. I visited [www.mvp.sos.ga.gov](http://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov) to check my status.\n\n**How do I actually vote after registering?**\n\n**Georgia Tech is actually an early voting site!**\n\nWhen: Late October, 9am-5pm\n\nWhere: John Lewis Student Center, Southern Co Multicultural Program Lounge\n\nHowever, the dates are currently inconsistent across different government websites. [Fultoncountyga.gov](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/inside-fulton-county/fulton-county-departments/registration-and-elections/early-voting-locations) and [ga.gov](https://mvp.sos.ga.gov/s/advanced-voting-location-information?election=a0p3d00000LWdF5AAL&countyName=FULTON&page=advpollingplace) says its Oct 24-25, the voter registration office told me in person its Oct 29-30... so I'm not totally sure. I called the voter registration office again to make sure so I'll update this post when its absolutely confirmed.\n\nPlease consider voting early to beat the poll lines before election day!\n\nEDIT: Its Five Points, not little five points, thanks for pointing out the typo! Also added a heads up that registering to vote in GA forfeits your right to vote in your previous state\n\nEDIT: By "proof of address" I mean you do not need to provide a pay stub or a bill with your address that is evidence you live there. You only need to write in your residential address and mailing address.

I received an offer after interviewing with a company from the career fair and it's a bit lower than I would like (77k in Pittsburgh). It's not like poverty wage or anything, but it's a few k lower than what Glassdoor and others list. I tried negotiating, they said no.\n\nI'm considering looking elsewhere, but I'm not entirely confident on getting another one, since none of my online applications have gone anywhere. Should I just take it and hope for a higher salary when I get a promotion or job search later with some actual experience under my belt? I think I'm a little scarred from my junior year internship search where I applied to a 100+ jobs and only got one offer lol.

If so, is everyone OK? \n\nThe right-hand exit lane on Williams Street is blind to south-traveling pedestrians and scooters. I've been asking someone to put up a mirror and a caution sign for years... since the advent of scooters, which make the problem scarier.

1fnsaug	engineer2moon	2024-09-23 18:56:19	20	74	So my dad went to Tech in the early 70’s and is basically retired now.\nSaid he was thinking about going back to school because he saw that the state of GA has free tuition for seniors?\nAnd he is pretty technically literate, (not just text, FB and email like many seniors).\n\nHe has had a PC since for over 30 years, (since DOS) does okay on MS Windows and most apps is not great on MS 365 but uses it.

I just got accepted into the Edison Engineering Development Program through GE Vernova which gives me the opportunity to concurrently pursue my Masters in Engineering at Georgia Tech while working at GE.\n\nMy offer letter said that I need to maintain a 3.0 GPA by the time I graduate at the end of the year to still have the offer active.\n\nI was wondering if that applies for getting into the Georgia Tech Masters program too?

1fszh73	Zealousideal-Trip767	2024-09-30 16:14:58	17	20	I’m a second year taking 14 credit hours right now (CS 1332, ARBC 1001, MATH 1554, CS 2340). A lot of my time is consumed by the project we have to do in CS 2340 and I spend the rest of my time trying to stay caught up in my other two classes. But i don’t have the time for linear algebra. I struggle to even understand concepts, let alone remember what I just learned. I took my first midterm in that class thinking I did alright with an exception of a question here or there but I ended up failing it with a 64%. I feel like I could’ve done well in this class if I put the time and energy into it but I’m two weeks behind on lecture material and I really don’t have the time/will power/mental health to handle a class of that difficulty and workload at the moment. My second midterm for linear is next week and I’m not sure of if I can pass it. If I fail another midterm I fear I won’t be able to pass the class and if I do it’ll be with a D and I can’t afford to lose Zelle as I’ve already lost it once. I want to know how bad the repercussions of withdrawing from a 4 credit hour class would be for my scholarship, graduation, and how employers will view me. I’m really lost on what I should do and I don’t even know what I should even be worried about. How should I go about this?

I am looking at the distance learning Aerospace Engineering program in particular. I found undergrad to be pretty easy ngl, but I didn't do engineering. Was wondering if anyone has any words of wisdom about the program in comparison to undergrad? Thanks!

Our club isn't an RSO yet, but we're going through the process. Before we started sending emails and reaching out to interested parties at UGA to organize the tournament, we wanted to make sure that we wouldn't be breaking any GT rules by organizing any competitions against another university. Does anyone know what the rules might look like in this situation? Should we waiting to register as an official GT club before reaching out? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\nIf you're interested in our club or hopefully competing against (and beating) UGA, feel free to DM this account or check out our Discord server!

This is not meant to attack or degrade anyone, and I want to approach this topic as civilly as possible. Please do not harass or attack me, any JW, any of the prostelyzers, or anyone else. Thank you, and hopefully this post was informative for you.\n—\n\nI saw JW on Tech Green this morning and if you are looking for a church to join I wanted to warn you with a personal experience and some other resources-\n\nMy family friends are without an extended family because they decided to leave JW, and my best friend in the entire world grew up without the support of his grandpa and grandma. This is a friendly-looking group that will separate you from your close family and friends unless they are already in the church.\n\n I recommend you read up on the history of JW (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses), or just the criticisms and features that align with a “cult” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Jehovah's_Witnesses). Again, this is my personal opinion and feel free to civilly disagree, but this group has brought a lot of harm to the people I love, so I do not consider them acting in good faith as a large organization.

1fheos9	Throwaway8264abc	2024-09-15 15:08:07	256	92	First I am aware I could've (maybe should've) gone to the dean for the absence but it's just a quiz and in the past this hasn't been an issue so I didn't think it was worth the extra work. I'm thinking of going now but want to know if there's anything I can do before going that far. \n\nHere's background info: \n\nI have a doctor's appt on Wednesday 9/18 when I also have a math quiz. \n\nLast week I told my prof and said I'd get him a note after the appt. \n\n(This is how I've always dealt with this type of problem since middle school and nobody has ever made a big deal out of it.)\n\nWhen I told him this he said he wants a note before. I told him I can't do that (because who tf writes a note before the appt??). He insisted and I was running late so I said I'll see what I can do and left. \n\nThe clinic says they won't write a note (not surprised). But I realized I can get a screenshot of my patient portal to show confirmation which I did. \n\nSo I've emailed him and he wants me to schedule the quiz with the testing center any other time on 9/18 (I have exam accommodations) but I can't because it's too late. Doesn't matter though because I don't even have time on that day to schedule it anyway. \n\nI asked if I can take it on Thursday or Friday (only a day or two after everyone else) and he is stuck on doing it Wednesday. Now he's asking me to choose between missing class or taking the quiz. \n\nHe hasn't responded since the last email I sent and I doubt he will so what do I do here?? \n\nAgain I'm planning to go to the dean but I'd like advice if there's anything I can do before or how to approach the dean with this\n\nPls help and thanks lol 	What do I even do here??? more context in caption	gatech	link	\N	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fheos9	/r/gatech/comments/1fheos9/what_do_i_even_do_here_more_context_in_caption/	-1	Question	-100	0	0

Then, less than 30 seconds later, I saw one hop the curb at the front entrance and an officer hop out yelling something as he entered the Publix. Just as quick as he entered , he hopped into his vehicle, zoomed off the curb and head into the Publix parking deck, tires screeching and loud banging coming from the deck. \n\nTwo minutes later I saw 2 APD enter the parking deck in the same fashion with a a GTPD vehicle lurking nearby. \n\nAny one have a clue about the situation? I was planning on going to Publix later but maybe I should take my grocery-needs elsewhere while I wait for it to die down.	What’s going on at the Publix?

1fdoucc	SuccessfulIncident83	2024-09-10 18:18:33	16	236	BEST has been an overall plague on so many GT events over the past few years. With the recent discussion on athletics troubles and career fair issues, I just wanted to publish my thoughts on things I’ve seen happen.\n\nEvery year we play at home for the uGA football game, the student section gets flooded and BEST “rent a cops” have always been belligerent to students, blocking them from their seats.\n\nLast year during the UNC football game, students stormed the field. The entire stadium atmosphere changed 1-2 minutes before the end of the game, and it was obvious it was coming. BEST security body checked and tackled the first few field stormers, despite 1000s more behind them. They injured at least 2 doing this, instead of dropping back to protect players and coaching staff.\n\nDuring a speech by Cabrera about the Israel/Palestine issues, they forcibly detained a Muslim student because he had a picture of a mosque as his phone background.\n\nJust recently, they’ve had pictures posted of their employees falling asleep when they should be checking/guarding bags at the career fair.\n\nI know GTPD doesn’t have the resources to do crowd control for minor events, which sucks since they’re usually pleasant to deal with. GT needs to step up their game and quit paying bottom dollar contractors with lazy employees who are wannabe cops who couldn’t pass a psych eval.

1fa7vu8	bx410	2024-09-06 05:45:26	39	150	I drink matcha lattes very often on campus so I made a ranking for all the places you can get matcha on-campus in case my fellow matcha lovers new to campus want to try (starbucks isn't considered on campus but whatever its close enough). you can use your dining dollars at all of these locations except starbucks.\n\n* **A tier:**\n   * **Gold and Bold (in Krone)**: i love it, there was one barista who always made it so well in fall 2023 semester when my matcha addiction started, wherever you are i appreciate you so much, you memorized my order for a hot matcha latte with almond milk and lavender syrup and made it perfectly\n   * **Kaldi's Coffee**: A tier ONLY IF YOU ASK FOR HALF SWEET. Could be S tier if they had like a 25% sweet option but idk i guess the default is sugar addiction for college students. They froth almond milk so well I could almost mistake it as oat milk because it makes the texture comparably thick.\n* **B tier:**\n   * **Kaldi's Coffee:** for the default sweetness, it is b tier because it is still too sweet for no reason\n* **C tier:**\n   * **Starbucks:** overpriced for what it is and also still extremely sweet by default, you could get better matcha for less money at kaldi's and gold & bold\n* **F tier:**\n   * **Dunkin:** literally the worst matcha you could get. I'm offended they would ever call it a matcha latte because its so terrible, it might as well be a pure sugar drink with 50g of sugar and like 1 single gram of matcha. you can't even adjust the sweetness level because the matcha is mixed with sugar in a pre-made mix. also because its a pre-made mix, the matcha quality is not good at all and not fresh. I'm convinced they put some sort of artificial coloring in there to make it green because its definitely not from the garbage matcha they use\n\nAs you can tell I really dislike overly sweet matcha lattes but I think Gold & Bold and Kaldi's is still the best because you can adjust the sweetness as much as you want, whether no sweetener or an insane amount. Dunkin is still terrible though I think their matcha latte should be considered a health hazard.\n\nEDIT: I didn't realize there is another Gold and Bold in IBB. I will be trying it out next week and get back to y'all on what its like.	ranking matcha lattes on campus	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fa7vu8/ranking_matcha_lattes_on_campus/	/r/gatech/comments/1fa7vu8/ranking_matcha_lattes_on_campus/	1	Discussion	93	93	1

1fa1tlw	MyEze	2024-09-06 00:18:03	13	152	Please re rack the weights to the place they should be. For me and many other students m, we’re tired of looking for a 25 and finding a 45, a 10, and a 5 where it should be. Since most of us are Georgia Tech students, I don’t think it’s wrong to assume we can read numbers taught to us in Kindergarten. If it’s too far back for you to remember, there are a few YouTube tutorials  on counting that my cousin found really helpful (she’s 3).\n\nAll jokes aside, please just put in the effort to read before placing your weights down. This really helps avoid confusion and injuries that can come from the potential tripping hazard. Simply looking at the number where the weights are and placing it accordingly can help so many people that want to get a workout it.

Been to this track about 5-6 times at this point and the racing and experience is pretty immaculate, definitely something you have to be in person to get how amazing it is. So if any of you guys are interested in motorsports and want to give watching NASCAR a try you should :D! The track is at 1500 Tara Place in Hampton, GA, which is about 30 miles from campus and isn't a bad drive or Uber ride even if that's what you prefer. Just figured I'd let y'all know in case any of you guys were interested haha	Y'all should try to attend the NASCAR race at Atlanta Motor Speedway this Sunday if you get the chance and are interested!	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1f9w8bn/yall_should_try_to_attend_the_nascar_race_at/	/r/gatech/comments/1f9w8bn/yall_should_try_to_attend_the_nascar_race_at/	1	Other	63	-63	-1

1f86llb	crayfish895	2024-09-03 17:58:19	32	134	The SGA will have an open forum discussion during their weekly legistlative meeting tonight at 7 PM in room 117 of the Smithgall (flag) building. This is an opprotunity for the many students who had issues with how block seating was handled last Saturday to express their concerns.\n\nI have a group meeting at 6:15 at the Whistle Bistro to get food and clearly lay out our requests. Please join us if you would like to add your own input (or if you just want to hang out and have a snack :))! Generally, these are the issues we want resolved:\n\n1. SWARM section seating should be the lower sections directly to the right and left of the marching band.\n\n* SWARM seating for the gold membership was advertised as being these sections, but this was not the case during gameday.\n* An overhaul of student block seating might be necessary with the increased demand and interest of the student body in football games. Since the SWARM section was falsely advertised and changes were already seemingly made, there is no reason additional changes cannot be made to improve the overall student section experience. Personally, I would propose a first-come first-serve system for all gold membership holders and a decreased priority for block seating.\n* Greek orgs, clubs, and other block seating that seemingly had access to the lower sections were late to attendance, leaving those sections empty until just before kickoff. This is detrimental to school spirit and the student body's support of the football team.\n\n2. Athletics must make immediate improvements to security and crowd control on gameday to avoid the consequences we faced in the student section last Saturday.\n\n* Major complaints being: students no being allowed back into the student section by security; abuse from securityl; mismanagement of checking wristbands.\n* SGA may not be able to make direct changes in this arena, but I hope this can help with communication to administration that the handling of student access to the game was unacceptable.

Thank you. \n\nHe did in fact have a concussion, you were 100% right, and just thank you man. I have no clue how you got him back in that thing or how you diagnosed it faster and more accurately than the official EMTs that saw him- but if you’re back in the lot, drinks on me. \n\nAlso it turns out Dad couldn’t remember his address, the time, or much else.

It’s from last year but Jamyr Gibbs and Jack Campbell were greeted the day after being drafted in the first round by Barry Sanders and GATech GOAT WR Calvin Johnson.  \n\nIt shows how CJ is epic and wants to help his former pro team even post retirement - as the best wide receiver to handle a football both on and off the field…. \n\nImagine being drafted in the first round and being greeted by CJ in his Hall of Fame Jacket the very next day.  \n\nI get chills!! \n\nIt’s a Detroit Lions YouTube doc segment that Tech fans might like if you guys still like Calvin \n\nI hope you think it’s cool because I think it’s amazing.

1f6btx7	Steamwhistleenjoyer	2024-09-01 11:03:10	10	206	Went to the game last night and had a good time but I know a lot of people can't say the same. From kickoff to around midway through the 3rd quarter I've never seen so much chaos in the GT student section. People sitting and standing in the stairs in all the sections by the field, the whole "concourse" area filled with people just standing there and then getting physically removed by officers (game wardens). I had a girl pass out next to me and then they blocked off all traffic at the wall near 120 so they weren't letting anybody walk to sections 118-112 even if they had tickets. People were getting pushed and shoved by security who had wristbands and tickets. I can't say every situation was perfect in everyone being honest, but the way people were getting yelled at was insane.  I've never seen the Tech SS like that even in uga games. I saw many students getting yelled at and threatened if they didn't move when they all thought they were in the right place. Seemed to be big discrepancy's in people knowing where their seats were and where to sit. It was poorly handled and all this talk about a new way to handle the SS was an utter failure and chaotic. Just keep it simple. 	About last night.....

That’s $60 total for lousy nosebleed seats.  There should be an option to purchase guest passes for a price — even $30 would be reasonable, as now you can sit together.\n\nIf the intention of football games is profit, then offering guest passes is a no-brainer (as you’re making money off previously “free” seats).

1f1o2mc	0xaaronlewis	2024-08-26 13:21:51	6	4	Hi, I am a CS major from a different university. We have “harder” classes that people are hesitant to take such as Operating Systems, and Comp. Architecture that largely deals with low-level programming. \n\nThe consensus is that these classes are challenging and can lower your GPA, but they *do* make you a better software engineer and give you a better understanding of computing. I was considering GT for a bit and I learned about threads which seemed like an organized way to pick ones electives. It seemed to me that there were threads considered relatively harder such as SysArch or InfoNetworks. Again these courses seem to deal with low-level programming that can be challenging for most. \n\nSo I wanted to ask r/gatech, in your observation do SysArch and InfoNetworks threads end up becoming better engineers than someone with less rigorous threads? Or do you believe that real-world experience (internships, co-ops etc.) is what best develops computing and engineering skills? Perhaps then one could ask if it is more prudent to pick easy threads that allow you to fully focus on internship grind (high GPA, leetcode), or pick threads that are rigorous to maximize learning from courses?\n\nI thought this would be interesting to ask r/gatech since I anticipate varied opinions. Again the goal is not which threads make the most money per se but which one becomes the best trained engineer. I would be really interested to hear if you have any thoughts since it could perhaps help myself and even younger students in their thread/elective selection! \n\n	Do CS majors that choose harder threads become better trained engineers?	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1f1o2mc/do_cs_majors_that_choose_harder_threads_become/	/r/gatech/comments/1f1o2mc/do_cs_majors_that_choose_harder_threads_become/	0	Question	0	0	0

1ezf4x6	Superschutte	2024-08-23 15:08:05	56	421	It blows my mind to say this, but 20 years ago (I'm OLD!) I went to Georgia Tech not being the biggest football fan.  I didn't hate it, my family only watched the super bowl once a year.  \n\nI went to Tech and watched Georgia Tech upset an Auburn team that was one of the best in the nation.  We tore down goal post and took them to G Wayne's house who chugged a beer and bought everyone pizza.  It was awesome.  Got hit by a car that night.\n\nThere is something special about a university team.  Tech was the hardest thing I ever did in my life.  Classes were terrible, I'm not smart enough to get in now days.  But being at the game made me feel like I belonged.  It let me blow off steam. \n\nYou too will grow old.  Your Saturdays will be filled with family commitments, maybe you'll get a job across the states.  You'll never again be as free as you are not to spend a Saturday in the sun, yelling at refs, and high fiving strangers around you.  If you don't know the rules, go on youtube.  If you didn't grow up in a football house, that's ok too, go anyway.  It's a social event as much as a sporting event.  \n\nSupport the team, support the institute, get some sun (or rain) and as always THWG.  Your future self will appreciate it.

1eyvdwe	FCBStar-of-the-South	2024-08-22 21:40:23	53	89	Tl;dr cannot believe I’m getting a free course on prisoner’s dilemma by sitting in waitlists\n\nCan someone please explain to me why the registrar thinks purging the waitlist last than 12 hours before the end of registration is a good idea? It single-handedly creates a cascading congestion on all waitlists that render the whole system frustrating for everyone.\n\nAs someone who is in the game, here is how I see it. Your basic strategy is as follows:\n\n1, waitlist for all your most preferred classes\n\n2, also waitlist for all your less preferred classes, and drop if you get your most preferred classes\n\n3, also waitlist for all other classes, regardless of preference, and drop if you get any of the first 2\n\nWhy is 3 a part of the strategy? Because in the free-for-all phase, your most reliable strategy to get 1 or 2 is via trading with other people. So by holding up a spot in a class, even if you have no intention of taking it, you gain bargaining power. Note how this would not be viable if the waitlists are maintained OR if the free-for-all phase lasts longer\n\nWhy is this toxic? For two reasons:\n\nFirst, while strategy 3 is in play, so are 1 and 2. So in addition to holding up a spot in a class, one is also holding up multiple spots in different waitlists. This artificially inflated the size of waitlists and create “phantom congestion”\n\nSecond, this is just classic prisoner’s dilemma. Let’s picture person A and B. Person A has a seat in a class that he doesn’t want but person B wants, and vice versa. \n\nThe efficient behavior would be if they both give it up since they don’t actually want the class. They lose some bargaining asset (the existence of which is ridiculous to begin with) but gains likelihood to enroll in their preferred class by moving up the waitlist.\n\nThe counterproductive behavior would be if they both stick to their current class. They retain bargaining power but doesn’t get closer to what they want\n\nIn the other two scenarios, say A gives up the seat and B doesn’t. Then A loses his asset without any gain.\n\nAnticipating the sickos who love the Friday house trading arguing that the counterproductive behavior is somehow more efficient, see my point about phantom congestion\n\nTo reiterate, this dilemma would NOT exist if the waitlists are maintained\n\n*slow claps* to GT admins for teaching us a valuable game theory lesson.

1eytait	throwaway-jacket	2024-08-22 20:12:33	17	15	Hey, so I'm a returning student who should be entering Spring 2025. Currently, I'm at Stony Brook.\n\nI'm a math major, and I was planning on concentrating in discrete math because I'm interested in math primarily but also cryptanalysis.\n\nMy question is, how's the math department here at GT? I know little about it since math wasn't my original major, but l've heard the discrete math program (for graduate students, at least) is pretty strong, which makes sense considering GT is a powerhouse for cybersecurity and computer science.\n\nI was also wondering, if it were up to you, would you come back to GT or stay at SUNY Stony Brook? Since I'm interested in cryptography, I feel like GT would be a no-brainer in that regard; however, I am still a sophomore. What if I end up liking pure or applied math better? Then I'll kick myself for not staying at Stony Brook.\n\nAlso, I plan on applying to grad schools, but I don't know much about that process other than the stuff on the applicants' end (researching programs/profs whose interests align with yours, etc.) How much does the "prestige" of your undergrad institution matter to admissions? I know Stony Brook math is nothing to scoff at, but do you think the GT name would give me a little bit more of an edge?\n\nI also wonder if the student body at Tech thinks the connections and networking at the school is worth coming back for on top of the other reasons.\n\nTLDR: How's the math here at GT? Worth coming back?\n\nThanks, and sorry for this massive block of text.

Even though I enrolled in the Graduate Internship Program, it seems that I’m classified as “voluntary” and the SHIP cost for the fall is $1800 instead of the subsided $300 or the “mandatory” $1200. Is this really the best I can do? I can’t imagine every co-op student relying on SHIP has to pay this much to get basic coverage?\n\nI’ve also checked healthcare.gov and the plans there are low quality and outrageously overpriced. I found that GT’s SHIP at $1800 is currently my best bet but I just thought with so many students doing co-op, GT would offer some way to make insurance affordable to students.

I just found out that I got into the top symphonic band, and my jazz audition results will be released Friday.\n\nIf I get into jazz band, would it be disrespectful to drop the symphonic band class given the work the professor has already put into placing me?

1ex15zp	Glad_Hurry8755	2024-08-20 17:11:26	15	16	**Context:** I am a 3rd year CS major who has been debating switching from people-media to intel-media, but I've been feeling guilty about having two psych classes now basically count for nothing. I then decided I should plan to just finish a psych minor to keep these classes in use while being intel now. However, i am debating if making my schedule harder for this minor is worth it or not. I am not too familiar with the intel class difficulties, but I obv know adding a memorization-based class into the mix every semester would probably not be worth it. Below is my plan, with that in purple being what applies to my minor. I would love input from the community, especially if you went through the intel thread.\n\n**Note:** If i stay people-media, i could graduate a semester early. However, ppl keep saying that people-media is a "waste" and its making me rethink doing people (plus i lowkey wanna graduate spring '26 anyways), which is why im prob opting to intel. Seems cool anyways\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dn90rw7qujd1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=92aee05a6fd29e20cf89dd252b10318b08690379	The worth of a minor with your degree?	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1ex15zp/the_worth_of_a_minor_with_your_degree/	/r/gatech/comments/1ex15zp/the_worth_of_a_minor_with_your_degree/	0	Discussion	0	41	1

I registered for a non-specialization class just so I don't get kicked out for not registering, but at this point its looking like that's the only class I'll be able to get this semester, which is quite frankly ridiculous. I'm almost certain the classes offered this semester will not be offered in the Spring, which means that if I don't get the classes this semester, I'll basically have to stay for another year, and probably end up paying another 7k or whatever the tuition ends up being. I don't know what to do. I haven't emailed my advisor because I can pretty much tell from previous experience that the reply is gonna be "Suck it up, we can't do anything". Anyone else experiencing this? What can I do other than live with it?

1ewjh4p	Wakkaaaaaaa	2024-08-20 01:44:45	15	3	As you may or may not know, the HOPE scholarship pays a prorated rate for your tuition depending on how many credits you're taking. For example, if you're taking 12 credits, you'll be receiving around $4000, despite the cost of tuition being above $5000. The only way for you to receive the $5000+ is for you to be enrolled in 15 credit hours. So my question is this: what happens if I enroll in 15 credit hours, and then drop 2 classes during add/drop, resulting in me having 12 credit hours?\n(I really don't want to take out a loan or get persecuted by the federal government lmao)	Does anyone know what happens if you drop a class after receiving your HOPE scholarship money?	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1ewjh4p/does_anyone_know_what_happens_if_you_drop_a_class/	/r/gatech/comments/1ewjh4p/does_anyone_know_what_happens_if_you_drop_a_class/	0	Question	0	0	0

There's this course I have taken that I'm not performing well in, so the professor has mailed me to drop the course now. The issue is that if I drop this course, I will go below 12 credits, which is important to maintain my full-time status. Of course, I can suck it up and finish the course with a B grade, but there's no indications right now (from the professor) that I might be able to do that.  \nThis is my first semester here and I'm stressed out about this situation, and what would happen if I become a "part time" student here, and what are the implications of that??  \nLooking forward to your suggestions.

1ewcmty	AssistantCurious7357	2024-08-19 20:44:13	14	32	I am a student with a W06 annual permit. W06 has several lots both on Marietta St. and Techway Dr. Specifically, it lists 811 Marietta St. as a parking zone included in this pass. \n\n811 Marietta St. has a gate, which is open during working hours only. On Saturday, I had to get GTPD to let me into the lot because the gate was closed, and my Buzzcard did not allow me access. I asked the officer if he knew why I couldn’t get in, and he said to contact parking services on Monday (today).\n\nEssentially, what parking services told me was that I’m not actually allowed to park there. In the W06 lot. With my annual W06 permit. Instead, I have to park in a less secure and further away W06 lot on Techway. Has anyone else encountered this issue? Parking on Techway isn’t the end of the world, but it seems terribly dishonest to sell parking on Marietta st. and then say it doesn’t include Marietta st. \n\nSo my questions are:\n\nDoes anyone else have experience parking in W06? Did you get the same info? \n\nWho do I need to talk to about getting the parking map rezoned? They should not be able to advertise this as W06 parking if you can’t park there with a W06 annual permit.\n\nFYI: I don’t think the PTS customer service line will be of particular help. I had to struggle all day with getting hung up on, put on hold, and condescended to just to get this much info. \n\nUPDATE: Thanks to someone sharing the org chart here, I was able to get in contact with the director of parking, William Boso (he also saw this post, hi!) He was very helpful and even met me in person to show me the access points I can use. He explained that there’s a complicated situation with PTS not having control over some of the readers and was able to explain which gates I could use to get into the lot.

1evtgis	reinersbooba	2024-08-19 04:51:51	5	3	Hi, currently rethinking all my choices right now. I am a first year ID student who is living off campus. I did this as it was “cheaper” than living on campus. I get Zell Miller/FASFA to cover my tuition and with that I get a pretty good refund. Almost enough for one semester of dorming. \nI got into summer semester and also commuted everyday, and i hated it lol. \n\nBasically Im doing rough calculations and the prices of living on campus sound much more ideal. I moved out & have roommates to share a house, however, I get my own room and everything. However bills, groceries, and GAS are expensive. I don’t have exact calculations on how much my cost of living is right now, but i’d guess living on campus might be cheaper atp. \n\nI will have to commute monday-friday for 7 classes (13 credit hours), and on top of that I have a part time job just to barely afford my bills. What should I do? Is there anyway I can apply for housing? At least for spring semester? \n\nWhile the cost of living would be similar I’d have to get a loan (possibly from a family member I have) just to pay it all upfront to the school. \n\nI live 40 minutes from campus, and that’s with no traffic, realistically gonna lose over an hour of time commuting. So not only do I miss out on events & friends, but I have to drive back and forth between work/existing. To give an example; I literally missed convocation because I was unaware of it & i was working anyways. I also have huge gaps / a kinda shitty school schedule bc my classes were only offered at certain times :(\n\nShould I just suck it up and live off campus for my first year? My course load will get a lot lighter second-fourth year, so I probably would prefer to live off campus anyways. I guess part of my feelings come from FOMO and the drag of just not being able to have a good experience. \nHowever, I don’t want to leave my roommates (one of them being my sister) with my share of the rent. I’d probably want to move back in my second year anyways. \n\nTLDR; I live off campus as I thought the expenses were cheaper, but I think living on campus might be a similar/better price. And I wouldn’t have to commute, what could/should I do?\n\nApologies if this doesn’t make sense, wrote this kinda fast. Any advice would be appreciated :D	Did I choose wrong as a first yr?

1evcasj	A1234234	2024-08-18 15:42:45	1	1	Hello again, I'm still having trouble with getting into my BS/MS classes. I used DocuSign and got into two courses I wanted to take. I wanted to sign up for 4 total BS/MS classes, because I am on the waitlist for the two courses I am currently signed up for. However, I could not get two of them signed via DocuSign despite putting in the requests. On August 16th, the permits drop according to this website: [https://www.cc.gatech.edu/student-registration-dates-information-graduate](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/student-registration-dates-information-graduate). This still did not allow me to get into the two other classes I wanted to get into, because I am currently encountering a level restriction error. I have no idea if there is a way to get that resolved. I imagine that I have to go through DocuSign again, but if there is a way around that please let me know. I've been waiting on one of the DocuSign requests to go through since May, so I really hope there is another way. I also emailed the registrar and asked if they could drop the permits for me. They told me that I first needed the permission of the department, so I sent an email to the CoC's graduate email address. No one responded past that. If there's anything I can try please let me know.

Of course, recruitment season also comes with the Fall semester. \n\nThe classes I’m taking are\n\nCS 2110 - computer architecture\nCS 1320 - Data structures and algorithms\nMath 1554 - linear algebra\nCS 2340 - objects and design\n\n\nIm a transfer and this will be my first semester and tech. I know the classes here are on a different level than the ones at other schools.\nI’ll also be working a part time job that requires about 20 hours(counting driving back and forth then 25hours). I haven’t started my leetcode grind yet for interviews and the internships already started opening up. I’m not sure if I should work this job or not. I feel as if I’ll regret working it if I can’t secure an internship because that 25 hours of my week going to a job rather than actual interview pre/leetcode/projects.\n\n\nI also commute so I live with my parents at home. They don’t require any money from me but they don’t give me any money to go out or to buy anything. They’re hard working people so I can’t ask them for money either.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

1euvq4f	Effective_Ad1413	2024-08-17 23:56:00	3	1	Recently moved in to my apartment about a week ago. I'm slightly west of campus. I was shocked seeing the only big supermarket stores nearby are either the Target/Publix north of campus, or the Publix east of campus near downtown. Both are over a mile walk, which is normally doable for me, but I have such a hard time dealing with the heat I don't want to go unless it's really early/late (which is a challenge in itself). \n\nWhat are good solutions to this? I delivered my groceries this week, and the prices were fairly reasonable, but it's not really feasible for stuff that goes bad quickly like produce. I've found some mini-mart/convience stores nearby that just have basics (bread/milk/eggs) but nothing beyond that.

1etnflj	FCBStar-of-the-South	2024-08-16 12:26:19	17	41	The MSCS program coordinator is now offering online versions of courses to on-campus students as an alternative to in-person sessions. They are doing this for networking and grad al.\n\nTo begin with, I am certain they had anticipated high demand for these courses and deliberately chose to not offer sufficient seats relative to the number of enrolled students. This is along with a slew of other courses that are core to the larger specializations.\n\nWhy? Because in their mind the online versions are acceptable alternatives when that is bordering on fraudulent. They failed to mention that you will not have contact with a professor and relatively less support from TAs. Most importantly, why am I paying on-campus tuition without the proper benefits? I doubt they will be refunding us the difference to the OMSCS tuition\n\nThis behavior is frankly abhorrent. I semi-expected to be treated like a cash cow but I still feel ashamed that I didn’t dig these BS up before deciding to come here.

1etiisr	aricer456	2024-08-16 07:19:27	6	4	Hello everyone,\n\nI’m a recent transfer admit (entering as a sophomore). I transferred from another 4-year university where I completed courses equivalent to PHYS2211, ECE2035, and CS1332. However, Georgia Tech rejected all of them, saying they weren't equivalent. This surprised me, as the content and timing closely match GT’s courses, and I'm familiar with 95% of the material based on syllabi and sample projects which I have taken a look at, especially the ECE2035 equivalent.\n\nThis has set me back significantly. I can’t register for 2 out of these 3 now-full courses this semester, and since they are prerequisites for other core courses for my major, I found this will likely delay my graduation by a year in total which will add a financial burden. I also know these courses also have very high workloads and so I’m also concerned about spending my time at GT repeating content I already know instead of actually advancing my education.\n\nI’m beginning to regret transferring and I'm seriously debating staying at my old college despite Georgia Tech being a college I really want to attend. Does anyone have advice or know of professors or contacts who could help re-evaluate my courses? My advisor hasn't been of much help so far.

I was told that I would get more solid information towards the end of the month.\n\nIn the meantime, I wanted to know how the GRA tuition waiver process works. I know that our tuition is due by the end of phase II, and since that is before the end of month, I am imagining that I would have to pay tuition upfront at first. If I get into the lab, then the amount would be reimbursed to my Bursar account. Can someone please confirm this?\n\nAdditionally, does working as a GRA guarantee that we get a tuition waiver? Particularly if it is our first semester working in the lab? Having my tuition covered would be of great help to me financially at this time, so please share your insights if you have had experience working as a GRA.  \n  \nThank you!

1eribkc	GigaBitGamer	2024-08-13 20:29:02	20	34	Hello. I'm a new first year at Tech (CS Major) and am really struggling to meet and connect with other people here on campus. So far I've followed all of the advice I've received from staff. I've been putting myself out there by attending WoW events such as Rock Ramble and Roll and today's scavenger hunt. I've held conversations with a good amount of people during these events or elsewhere (dining halls, student center, etc). However, in all of these conversations I've felt like an outsider or a third wheel. They've all been one-offs too. I haven't been able to reconnect with any of them. At this point I feel kind of left out and it's killing my motivation to keep attending WoW events. I'm hoping that when classes start things will improve but if I can't connect with people now then I doubt  I'll be able to during classes. I'm posting this here because I not only want to remain anonymous but also potentially recieve advice from fellow first years who are succeeding in making new connections or older students who have gone through my same situation. I'm sorry if this breaks any rules. Thank you.

I just got a job as a student assistant and it says the minimum hours per week is 15, and I was hoping to work something closer to 10. Has anyone had experience with wanting to work less and if so has your boss been flexible? My new boss asked me to send the hours I’m available to work and I was wondering if i should just send her time ranges that are less than 15 hours and see if that’s a problem.

1er6t2f	Loxe77	2024-08-13 12:38:42	5	14	Ok, I know mostly how they work, but I’m in a specific situation that necessitates some questions.\n\nIn Phase 1, I registered for the waitlist of a class, and after the phase ended, I remained on the waitlist. I’m still on it, and now there are three open seats in the class (I’m position 2, so I know I have one). However, I haven’t yet received an email allowing me to register for it.\n\nMy guess is that this is because it’s really early in Phase 2, so the person in front of me quite literally can’t register for it yet because they haven’t begun their time ticket. So since they can’t register, the waitlist can’t move, so I can’t register either. Is this accurate, or does the waitlist skip someone in line in the case that they aren’t able to register yet?

You are invited to participate in a research study that investigates the ways that people think about their personal experiences including future scenarios and how their thinking may be related to well-being and self-processes. This study involves an online survey session (20-30 mins) and an in-person session (1.5 hours). You will be asked to submit 1 headshot/selfie and 6 photos of your birthday celebrations as you complete the online survey. Those photos will be used to facilitate thinking exercises during the in-person session. An in-person session will take place in the JS Coon Building in Atlanta, Georgia about 3-5 days after your completion of the online session. You will be asked to engage in thinking exercises in a Virtual Reality environment or through a computer, fill out a battery of questionnaires, and complete cognitive tests. **Your time will be compensated $20 for full participation.** Georgia Tech students can elect to receive 2 credits for full participation. 0.5 credits will be assigned if only the online session is completed.

1fqqvrp	stressedkitty8	2024-09-27 15:48:16	5	16	Hey ya all, hope everyone's doing good during the flash flood. I'm a grad student who took 15 creds (yes 15, but there's a reason) because I was primarily unsure of one of the courses I took and wanted to have a backup option. Now we are in that phase of the semester when I am highly rethinking my decision of even taking this course. To clarify, this course was optional, I don't have to take it so even if I withdraw it will have no impact. The reason why I took it is that I am very, very interested in the course content. I am unfamiliar with this topic and wanted to learn more about it. I also clarified with the professor if any background knowledge is required for this course, but they reassured me that I will be fine.\n\nNow the problem is, I did not know how mismanaged the course was and dry the lectures will be. The professor just reads from slides, and the projects are killing me. It is very hard for me to go to office hours because they clash with my other classes. That said I did go to TAs a couple of times, but the course content is really hard, and I feel like I don't even understand what they are teaching me. I know, I sound dumb. Maybe it's the background issue, I don't know. But I assure I have been trying hard so idk what's wrong. I have only slept for 8-10 hours in the past 5 days because of a project that was due for this course. I fear my other courses will be compromised if this continues (which I obviously don't want). I personally think, I can't do this anymore. But I also don't want to withdraw because as I said, I love the course content. I want to learn. It's just the course design and difficulty that is making it so hard for me. I have considered declaring the course as pass/fail but I am unsure. Objectively speaking, what would be the ideal decision to make here? Should I really withdraw, or convert to pass/fail?

1fxabl0	crayfish895	2024-10-06 06:30:05	8	152	First off, it is amazing we are filling out BOTH endzones. I am so excited about how far we've come. This post is a little bit of venting and some constructive criticism about a few incidents during the Duke game, but overall, it is incredible to see our student body showing out to cheer on the Jackets!\n\nStill, there are a few things we need to improve on to be the fanbase these players deserve.\n\nMost importantly, I think we can all agree that the trash thrown on the field on at least three occasions was completely unacceptable. As a fanbase and school, we have a reputation to develop and uphold, and we will not be like certain other fanbases in our state and conference. If you need a more tangible reason, our team will be penalized during the game and that could result in serious consequences within the game.\n\nNow, I'm sure the assholes actually doing this stuff aren't going to be reading this post. All I ask for from y'all is a zero tolerance for these types of things and make sure "fans" like this know that they do not belong in the student section.\n\nOn a less serious note, we really need to shut up when our offense is on the field. Chanting and cheering is cool when the stakes aren't too high, but if our team is trying to finish off a drive in the redzone, it does not help when their fans are shouting at them. Consistent homefield advantage is incredibly important and we will desperately need it against Notre Dame and Miami in the coming weeks. Help me out here and let your friends know to quiet down when we have the ball.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been fantastic in bringing the noise when we're on defense. Keep that up and turn it up to 11!\n\nMaybe I'm overreacting to some of this stuff, and feel free to call me out if that's the case. This is just an extremely valuable aspect of student life for me and I felt like something needed to be said.\n\nThank you to all who have been showing out to these games. We've had some growing pains to go through, but I believe we are on track to make Bobby Dodd one of the best stadium environments in the country.\n\nGo Jackets!

I stopped by Publix tonight, but to my surprise/horror nobody was buying what I'd consider storm supplies ("eggs, milk, and raw steaks" are not a wise choice...). I pray the people I was in line with are an outlier, but just in case they aren't:\n\n* Assume your power will go out long enough for everything in your fridge to go bad. \n* Assume you will not have power for boiling water. \n* While it's pretty unlikely, prepare for the possibility of no running water (way better to buy a gallon or two of distilled water for $3 and not need it than other way around).\n\nThis usually boils your options down to cans, bread, peanut butter, and bottled water, maybe fresh fruit or similar.

I totally get the complaints about getting sidetracked, and I honestly had to learn a lot of things on my own, but he was one hell of a lad to me. I remember stopping by his office once in a while to catch up and just talk about my personal problems, careers, or questions about some concepts that I didn't fully understand. I was actually planning on stopping by last week...until that happened. While he did make a lot of inappropriate jokes and what he did recently seems messed up, he was also one of the most caring faculty members at GT that I've met.

1fj38b2	MudMe	2024-09-17 16:10:35	1	27	Happy Constitution Day and Citizenship Day!\n\nA great way to celebrate is by Registering to Vote [https://vote.gov/](https://vote.gov/) if you are eligible to do so!  \n\nConstitution Day commemorates the formation and signing of the U.S. Constitution by thirty-nine brave men on September 17, 1787, recognizing all who, are born in the U.S. or by naturalization, have become citizens. [http://www.constitutionday.com/](http://www.constitutionday.com/) \n\nSeptember 17, Constitution Day (or Citizenship Day) is an American federal observance that recognizes the ratification of the United States Constitution and those who have become U.S. citizens. It is observed on September 17, the day the U.S. Constitutional Convention signed the Constitution in 1787. The law establishing the holiday was created in 2004 with the passage of an amendment by Senator Robert Byrd to the Omnibus spending bill of 2004. Before this law was enacted, the holiday was known as "Citizenship Day". In addition to renaming the holiday "Constitution Day and Citizenship Day," the act mandates that all publicly funded educational institutions provide educational programming on the history of the American Constitution on that day. **In May 2005, the United States Department of Education announced the enactment of this law and that it would apply to any school receiving federal funds of any kind.**\n\n**U.S. Dept of Education:** [**https://www2.ed.gov/policy/fund/guid/constitutionday.html**](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/fund/guid/constitutionday.html)Each educational institution that receives Federal funds for a fiscal year is required to hold an educational program about the U.S. Constitution for its students on September 17 (if it falls on a weekend; it should be held in the previous or next week).\n\n**Georgia Dept. of Education:** [**https://www.gadoe.org/Curriculum-Instruction-and-Assessment/Curriculum-and-Instruction/Pages/Constitution-Day.aspx**](https://www.gadoe.org/Curriculum-Instruction-and-Assessment/Curriculum-and-Instruction/Pages/Constitution-Day.aspx)Public Law 108-447 requires the designation of Constitution Day and Citizenship Day on September 17 of each year. The purpose of Constitution Day and Citizenship Day is to commemorate the formation and signing on September 17, 1787, of the Constitution and recognize all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, have become citizens.  Please remember to recognize September 17th, Constitution Day, in your system/school.\n\n**Trivia:**\n\n* The U.S. Constitution has 4,400 words. It is the oldest and shortest written Constitution of any major government in the world.\n* Of the spelling errors in the Constitution, "Pensylvania" above the signers' names is probably the most glaring.\n* Thomas Jefferson did not sign the Constitution.\n\n\n\n**Regulatory reference:**\n\n**§106. Constitution Day and Citizenship Day**\n\n(a) Designation.-September 17 is designated as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.\n\n(b) Purpose.-Constitution Day and Citizenship Day commemorate the formation and signing on September 17, 1787, of the Constitution and recognize all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, have become citizens.\n\n(c) Proclamation.-The President may issue each year a proclamation calling on United States Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Constitution Day and Citizenship Day and inviting the people of the United States to observe Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies.\n\n(d) State and Local Observances.-The civil and educational authorities of States, counties, cities, and towns are urged to make plans for the proper observance of Constitution Day and Citizenship Day and for the complete instruction of citizens in their responsibilities and opportunities as citizens of the United States and of the State and locality in which they reside.\n\n([ Pub.

1ep4p7k	_____duck	2024-08-10 22:06:34	7	15	# Introduction\n\nI am a Computer Science major in my second year of college.\n\nWhen deciding on classes to take over the summer, I could only find a few, recent anecdotal evaluations of how x credit hours over the summer were, and rarely did they include much detail.\n\nMy consensus, from Reddit, my friends, and my advisor, was that 14 credit hours was a bad idea. Given that a regular semester was 1.5x the length of a summer semester (15 vs 10 weeks), one may consider an equivalent number of "regular" credits 1.5x the number of summer credits, meaning that I would be taking an equivalent 21 credit hours.\n\nFor some reason, I stuck with my classes. I write this review for those who may find themself in a similar position.\n\n# Classes\n\nI took 4 classes:\n\n* CS1332 - Data Struct & Algorithms (3)\n* CS2110 - Computer Organiz&Program (4)\n* CS2340 - Objects and Design (4)\n* MATH1554 - Linear Algebra (4)\n\nI will speak about them in order of decreasing difficulty.\n\nCS2340 was a group project class. For reasons you can imagine, this was my hardest class. Outside of doing my member's work for them, I felt little control over my grade. I don't blame my group members, though. There just wasn't enough, policy-wise, to hold individual members directly liable.\n\nCS2110 was fine. The quizzes were challenging but timed labs were typically guaranteed scores. The homework was time-consuming.\n\nCS1332 was also fine. The midterm and final were each 44% of the final grade. This was stress-inducing but a decent amount of studying had me fine.\n\nMATH1554 was unnotable. I found it interesting. (See relevant disclosure)\n\nI earned an A in all four classes.\n\n# Extracurriculars\n\nI held a position as a research assistant and put in an average of \\~10 hours a week.\n\n# Disclosures\n\nI transferred to Tech from Georgia State this past summer. I took classes there that are relevant to CS1332 and CS2110 but did not qualify as transfer credit.\n\nCS2720 (Data Structures) did not cover several topics from CS1332, including sorting, pattern matching, graph, and DP algorithms and assessment were not as thorough as CS1332. I also took CS4520 (Design & Analysis of Algorithms) which did transfer as CS3510 (same class) which covered what CS1332 did not.\n\nCS3210 (Computer O&P) covered weeks 4-5 of CS2110, basically just assembly programming. Instead of assembly for the LC-3, the class taught assembly for x86.\n\nI claim that these past classes provided only a marginal advantage for CS1332 and CS2110, from my personal experience and comparing my experience with that of a friend taking the same classes, who hadn't taken those classes.\n\nRegarding MATH1554, I must disclose I had a great advantage. I took this course twice in high school (once rigorous, once not) and used linear algebra in some classes in my freshman year (Diff Eq, Numerical Analysis I, Deep Learning).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe semester was not easy, but it was doable.\n\nI commuted from home (\\~30 minutes) and was at school \\~9 am-7 pm M-W, and 12 pm-3 pm Th, F, with a standard deviation of maybe 2 hours.\n\nMy mom cooked food for me, which I had for lunch (packed) and dinner. I also occasionally ate out. Cooking and cleaning are significant time consumers and I am fortunate it was done for me. I cooked for myself in my freshman year, which took up \\~3 hours daily.\n\nDespite the work, I could still see friends, go out, waste time on my phone, etc.\n\nWould I do it again? This past summer, yes. I'm proud of the productivity. In a future summer, no. I was excited at first but it wore off to the point where I strongly disliked school. I would have enjoyed more time to relax and pursue other hobbies (cooking, exercise, arts, etc.). The classes were interesting, but in the end, it was still school.\n\nI hope this was helpful, or at least entertaining. Any questions are welcome.

1emqiyf	Entmoot747	2024-08-07 23:16:53	11	14	I'm entering my second year at Tech, and am thinking about the prospects of double majoring in math and CS. So far, I've been doing well in classes and have time for extracurricular activities. If I don't pursue this, I can get out in 3 years with a BS in CS and potentially a minor in Math. If I wanted to, I could also probably stick around for another year for the BS/MS option. I've mapped it out, and I can definitely finish in 4 years with a double major. As an in-state student I have the Hope/Zell scholarship so I think it at least makes sense to stay at GT for 4 years either way. Aside from financial aid, 4 years makes sense to me for potentially getting more expereience with internships for a job, more time for clubs, and adds time to the college experience. I would like to hear from other people who have done or are pursing a double major with Math + CS and if they think it's worth it or not.

1f2wgks	belvitabar	2024-08-28 00:10:42	83	237	I'm just starting my 3rd year, and this year seems like they have just an absurd amount of construction,\n\n2 years ago it was just the campanile, and that was finished a little while later.\n\nNow it feels like half the campus is under construction. Obviously Im for the new bike lanes I think they are a great addition, I just dont like the feeling of literally everywhere I go on campus I'm hearing loud noises, torn apart roadways and buildings, and my pathways/roadways are blocked!!\n\nAnyone else feeling irritated?\n\n  \nEdit: Thought I would share some thoughts about some of the replies. A lot of you guys seem to be very jaded about the amount of construction. I disagree with your attitude. Call me naive, yeah sure I'm not some 10/20 year alumni whose been here since before the Olympics or covid. But I disagree with the sentiment of "that's just the way it is lol get over it." I'd rather speak up and voice my opinion about something that I dont like. And fortunately there are some that do agree with me, or at the very least not the construction but the percieved lack of planning. Again, I'm not against the improvement of campus, I'm not against construction, I'm against just the amount of construction occurring all it once / poor scheduling. Continuing, the whole "it shows your school has money" argument is bs when kennesaw state right up the road has food that's 10 times better than the food-poisoning inducing "bacon" that they cooked at willage my freshman year. There's more ways to improve a college and money dump than construction/buildings. Apartment buildings, that way construction is not in the middle of campus. Some sort of artwork that's not a weird ice cream cone or whatever the fuck those ​orange pool noodles are. More hybrid buses. Better faculty pay. More professors. Last note, in a perfect world, i would want some sort of agreement to limit the amount of construction that could occurr at one time. Want to build those bike lanes? Dont do at the same time you renovate the stadium and make traffic even worse in two choke spots on campus. Want to renovate the stairs by the sudent center? If its possible, do most of it over the summer so people arent thru-trafficking the inside of the student center or the W21 parking lot. Yes I can recognize that is a fantasy, but I'm not gonna back down and say that's not what I want. Thank you all for the feedback.

Using existing open source tech / hardware.. I want to transform this farm.bot product/platform into a mobile gardener… that has solar panels, a water tank, a wireless / Bluetooth connection, and an intelligent control system so watering / gardening can be automated.. \n\nhttps://farm.bot/\n\nThinking each wheel is independently controlled (4-wheel drive..) and would be similar to e-scooter wheels…\n\nEvent link: https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/event/10276371?utm_source=CREATE-X+Georgia+Institute+of+Technology&utm_campaign=0b65802bbb-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_01_02_05_42_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-cbde9ef724-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D&mc_cid=0b65802bbb&mc_eid=8a7e42d9c1\n\n\nIdeally the plan is to apply this first farm automation tech stack to local small-medium size farms here in GA, learn from that and improve the device / offerings, and help use this as part of the financial calculation to move in a more regenerative / less industrialized method of farming.. Similar idea is an automatic chicken coop that is moveable / controllable without human interaction (as in the farmer / producer doesn’t have to go hook up a tractor and move the structure themselves..)\n\n\nOpen to any thoughts, feedback, or ideas! Would love the help and collaboration. Ideally I’d like to continue on the open source development and provide the expertise / know-how / hardware / implementation as a service in collaboration with existing hardware providers… so we all can grow more food closer to home! \n\nHope to see some of y’all there! \n\n\n	Idea 2 Prototype Launch Meeting Tonight in Klaus 2448 @ 5pm!	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1ew9gjw/idea_2_prototype_launch_meeting_tonight_in_klaus/	/r/gatech/comments/1ew9gjw/idea_2_prototype_launch_meeting_tonight_in_klaus/	0	Social/Club	0	19	1

1em0owu	Diligent_Necessary92	2024-08-07 02:39:15	4	2	I'm a rising senior at Tech and I have two directions I can pursue for my last year, and I am having trouble deciding.\n\nAt the end of my last summer internship, my manager asked if I can work part time, fully remotely during my last year of school and then transition to full time after graduation. The thing is, I don't know if the part time is a requirement for full time offer, and I'm worried that if I tell them I can't work part time, I will not get that full time offer.\n\nCurrently, I have a GPA slightly above 3.0, and I plan to apply for masters. My original plan was to take 18 credits of easy classes in the Fall to raise my GPA and strengthen my master's applications. Since I only need 12 credits to graduate, taking additional courses over the Fall and Spring would also allow me to earn a business analyst certification, which I'd have to forego if I accept the part-time job.\n\nAdditionally, I don't know if the full time is guaranteed even if I take the part time, and the pay for the internship wasn't the best. I'm still applying to other companies for full-time roles, but I'm not confident in my chances of landing a job elsewhere.\n\nTo organize the pros and cons for the 2 options simply:\n\n**Option 1:** take the part time offer and only take 6 credits of courses, give up on business certification, give up on increasing GPA, and apply to masters with my currently GPA (low acceptance chance)\n\n**Option 2:** give up on the part time offer (possibly giving up on the full time offer), take 18 credits during the Fall semester to raise the GPA and apply to masters. Apply to other companies for full time offers (not confident).\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me?

My school didn’t offer any honors or AP classes which meant I never really challenged myself. I don’t even know how to take notes, let alone actually learning things efficiently for a degree in ME.\n\nEvery time I see some day in the life of a student at literally any university, seeing students on their laptops studying actually makes me ache. How am I supposed to learn? What if I really don’t understand anything and don’t have the time management to catch up? A bit cliche, but I am scared of failing, especially as an international and on a sponsorship.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I want to be at GT. I want to be challenged, but there is some irrational fear within me questioning if I am prepared.\n\nHas anyone gone through the same feelings? If so, how did you go through it and overcome it? How do you learn to study, hell what does smart study even mean??\n\nApologies for the long rant. Thanks in advance!

You have to work for _yourself_ and no one else, because this institution places no emphasis on mentorship, placement assistance, or support of its recent graduates.\nNo one is going to help you make connections.

1ektp5h	TestosterTyrone	2024-08-05 17:28:11	8	24	So I was admitted to tech in the fall as a transfer student and I withdrew from my summer linear algebra course at my previous institution. To keep it short and sweet, I withdrew because the professor was shitty and unorganized and that reflected in her lectures and the structure of the online course modules. But anyway, after submitting my final transcript, they added an “enrollment concern explanation” form to my admission portal to explain the withdrawal. Has anyone gotten this form before?

1ejypyx	One_Virus7101	2024-08-04 16:04:29	4	7	\nI’ve been looking for a psychiatric evaluation for ADD/ADHD as I believe I’m showing many of the symptoms I read about and did quite a few diagnostic quizzes online which pointed out the same. I was wondering if there are good doctors/psychiatrists with no wait times? And I also would prefer if I don’t spend too much ($200) is about what I’m willing to pay for an appointment out of pocket, but every psychiatrist outside of Tech charges over 400 without insurance. I only have the Gatech student health insurance (UHCSR), and it seems like they don’t cover much outside of services at Tech Psychiatry and STAMPS. Also how long would it take to be prescribed meds like adderall or other stimulants that can help me focus? It feels like my brain has been slowly deteriorating and scrambled and it’s also showing in the form a downward performance in my grades. I can write another post/comment on this one about what I’m feeling if it will help me get my life back together. Any doctor recommendations with no/minimal wait times will be very appreciated!!!!

1eh4y92	Pachriksu	2024-08-01 01:58:24	6	9	I'm in a bit of a tough situation regarding a rec letter from a CS professor for BSMS. Partially my own fault, but I never got to know any CS professors personally because every class was so big, and now I only have 1 semester left to apply for BSMS. I actually managed to get rejected last semester, so I guess they are starting to review applicants more rigorously now. 3.97 GPA, 3 rec letters. Before you ask about VIP, yes, that was one of them and I know him well, but the professor is ECE.\n\nI think one of the biggest reasons was that the rec letter from the CS professor I asked was weak, since they only could report how I did in their class since they didn't really know me. Therefore, I'm looking for a way I can get to know a CS professor well not only by the fall semester end, but by the withdrawal deadline (Oct 26) which is when BSMS applications are due.\n\nMy question is - is this possible? I've thought about starting to cold email CS professors so I can do research with them this fall, and even then, it might be a gamble on how much time the position allows me to interact directly with them (instead of their assistants, etc), and making a good enough relation for a decent rec letter by the deadline.\n\nAs for getting to know professors through courses, I am going to take 2 CS classes in the fall, so going that route I'll have to make sure to be very active during lectures and go to their office hours (hopefully if not all run by TAs). However, I have been refused a rec in the past because the professor only wrote letters for their research students.\n\nSo guys, how cooked am I? I would really appreciate if anyone has some advice based on my situation or some insight that I could utilize.

However, there are still several bus stops that don’t have shelters. \n\n* Kendeda\n* Across from Klaus by Russ Chandler Stadium\n* Corner of Hemphill Ave and Ferst Dr.\n* And several others!\n\n\n\nBus shelters protect us from rain and sun while waiting for the bus, and provide passerbys a shady sidewalk. Every bus stop should have some sort of protection. How can we get more of them? Who can we petition? \n\nOr are there plans to add more? I’ve looked at the renders for the Ferst Dr cycle track, and it looks like there will be upgraded shelters in some spots. But I don’t see any additional shelters in the plans (correct me if wrong). \n\n[Kendeda - You are... shelterless...](https://preview.redd.it/3dg51aleirfd1.jpg?width=4608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b6e043b70c39a0a3f4e80067c5baf1726406002)\n\n	More Bus Shelters Around Campus Please!	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1egbsgo/more_bus_shelters_around_campus_please/	/r/gatech/comments/1egbsgo/more_bus_shelters_around_campus_please/	0	Discussion	0	0	0

I’ve been looking for a job since last December and I’ve had 2 interviews the entire time lol, definitely feeling pretty beaten down. I was thinking about going back to school and getting a different degree. I started out as mechanical engineering so probably that but I’m not sure how to go about it out doing that. I definitely don’t know enough about mechanical to do a masters, I only really passed statics and then switched so it’d be pretty much like starting over. I’ve tried to ask my advisor who I can talk to but she’s useless. Does anyone know if I can still take classes or do I have to reapply and get admitted again for another undergrad degree?

(for example, you may gain the ‘self-compassion lens’ when you’re being too harsh on yourself). going beyond recommendations, it handholds you to apply the perspectives to your situation/story right away.\n\nour early users have used it to cope with anxiety, process mixed feelings, navigate uncertainty, regain motivation, and more. it has been used independently as well as alongside other resources, such as therapy and meditation.\n\nborn out of our own needs to navigate everyday challenges with clarity and wellbeing, we continue to build Thinking Lens with care and intention. it’s now built alongside advisory support from leading clinical and research institutes. it’s also appreciated by several mental health professionals eager to recommend it (including former jackets who’ve spent decades in the tech industry and then shifted gears to the mental health space). we’re now in our private beta and would love to offer some free spots for feedback. if you think you can use this app as extra support and give us your honest feedback, please dm me or leave a comment below. iOS users will get an install link, while Android users will be among the first to get notified when the Android version is available.\n\nthanks for reading this and for considering joining our mission to help everyone flourish from within!	my sister and i built a mental-wellbeing app for everyday situation outside a chemo room. would love to share it with those who can benefit 🤍🫡🐝	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1eefk7c/my_sister_and_i_built_a_mentalwellbeing_app_for/	/r/gatech/comments/1eefk7c/my_sister_and_i_built_a_mentalwellbeing_app_for/	1	Other	68	68	1

1eo3gh0	dizastermaster7	2024-08-09 16:00:13	3	25	So I'm a "fourth-year" at Georgia Tech and I'm having issues affording the school. Not that we all aren't, but the amount that I get from financial aid should at least cover tuition, but I'm still stuck in the red because of a "rotating balance" from 2 years ago. In my 2nd year, my EFC unexpectedly went up, and I had increased my costs by living on campus and taking out a meal plan, and ended up owing around $13,000 to the school. Since financial aid through the school wasn't going to cover that, over the Summer of 2023 I took out a private loan to cover that specific Spring 2023 balance. \n\nHowever, somewhere along the line, the Financial aid office decided to change the loan terms without my consent to a Fall 23-Spring 24 loan. This meant that the loan would be split in half, going to 2 future semesters, and none of the money would actually go to the semester the loan was originally applied and approved for. Whenever I brought this up to Financial Aid, they told me to speak to my lender about it, but my lender revealed that it was due to how Financial Aid incorrectly certified the loan. Financial Aid then lied and said that I originally applied for a Fa23-Spr24 loan, and lied saying they could not recertify it. This led to my prior balance causing the Bursar to cancel my classes for Fall 23 and Spring 24, while keeping the housing charges tacked on. It was only last semester, Spring 24, when Financial Aid admitted they DID change the loan term themselves, and they COULD recertify the loan, but only wanted to increase my loan to pay even more rather than fixing their mistake. They also canceled my Spring scholarships and grants they originally awarded me as if to wring every penny out of me, as if they were still awarded I could have actually afforded last semester. \n\nI just got my Financial Aid offer TODAY (because any sooner couldn't possibly have been reasonable, right?) and in total, it's barely enough to cover this semester's tuition, much less my past balance that's been dragged forward since last Spring. They discontinued the student access loan, every external scholarship/grant I've applied for I've been rejected or denied for some reason or the other. I've spoken to Financial Aid EXTENSIVELY, the Bursar, the Dean of Students office, the Housing office, my donors, and none of them could help me, and Financial Aid doesn't even seem to care (they don't even use my name in responses, they just refer to me as "the student" in replies TO ME). \n\nAt this point I just want to know if anyone here has any advice, any contacts, resources, etc. Or just can attest to anything similar? It's just extremely screwed what they've done and, in my opinion, shouldn't be let off the hook, but I can't really do anything about it myself.

You are invited to participate in a research study that investigates the ways that people think about their personal experiences including future scenarios and how their thinking may be related to well-being and self-processes. This study involves an online survey session (20-30 mins) and an in-person session (1.5 hours). You will be asked to submit 1 headshot/selfie and 6 photos of your birthday celebrations as you complete the online survey. Those photos will be used to facilitate thinking exercises during the in-person session. An in-person session will take place in the JS Coon Building in Atlanta, Georgia about 3-5 days after your completion of the online session. You will be asked to engage in thinking exercises in a Virtual Reality environment or through a computer, fill out a battery of questionnaires, and complete cognitive tests. Your time will be compensated $20 for full participation. Georgia Tech students can elect to receive 2 credits for full participation. 0.5 credits will be assigned if only the online session is completed.\n\n	2 Part Future Thinking Research Study (18 - 39 years old, fluent in English, and have no vision issues when wearing glasses/contacts)	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1ebvzo1/2_part_future_thinking_research_study_18_39_years/	/r/gatech/comments/1ebvzo1/2_part_future_thinking_research_study_18_39_years/	0	Survey/Study/Poll	0	0	0

I was wondering if anyone had experience before of doing a full-time Fall internship and receiving the tuition waiver at the same time (no GRA stipend)? Or did you have to do part-time Fall internship and part-time GRA to receive the tuition waiver?\n\nI’m very confused so any help would be appreciated!

1eap392	gc0700	2024-07-24 01:29:41	8	10	I'm a rising senior this year, and I'm nearly sure I want to go to GA tech for engineering majoring in either EE or CE. However, based on my interests along with extracurriculars, I have no idea which to apply for or write about in my "Why choose your major at Ga Tech" essay. I'm passionate about math and science, and have taken all the highest level ones at my school and am dual enrolling in math at tech this year, and I have a position on math team for my school as well as some other ECs so I feel like my math ecs are decent. But, I never really got into robotics or anything and my highschool doesn't have a team so I feel like I'm lacking in that field for applying for engineering, since I don't have any real experience in engineering at all. I did take AP CSP and work on a CS project this last year that I really enjoyed, but I haven't taken AP CSA, so would this hold me back? This is a bit of a rant but my main question is would choosing either one benefit or hurt me for my essay? I've always liked technology and computers and math, so I feel like I'm leaning towards CE, but I truly have no idea since I've never done any real engineering stuff. Also can any EE or CE majors/alumnis at tech comment on their experiences with either program and benefits to each?

1e5otgv	ChillioX	2024-07-17 18:00:19	32	11	For context, I'm a MSCS student going into their last semester, never did on-campus housing, and was really hoping to land some on-campus housing because I've heard their flexibility in allowing for students to only do 1-semester for housing. \n\nLike a fool, I forgot to apply for housing the picosecond it opened and so I got like #104 on the waitlist (I filled it out during a doctors appt an hour or so after it opened). I had I feeling I was cooked, but I hoped that filling out a priority waitlist form would help out (on the [GT housing FAQ page](https://housing.gatech.edu/applicants/faqs) it said that if you are planning to graduate Fall 2024 then you should fill out a priority waitlist form). On data from previous years though, 2022 had \\~120 people get off the grad housing waitlist, but 2023 had \\~70 people get off the list (might be wrong on the years). I'm pretty sure I filled it out as soon as it became available, but I'm not all too certain.\n\nEither way, I got a text the other day saying that they don't expect the waitlist to move anymore and that I should look for off-campus housing. I thought it might've been an advertising thing, so I look today and I'm at waitlist spot #90. I was surprised, so I called the housing office about it and, sure enough, they confirmed to me that they are at capacity and that the text was sent based on data they had.\n\nI also asked about the priority waitlist form and they told me they had all been taken into consideration. I asked how soon-to-be-graduated people weighed into waitlist decisions, but they weren't able to tell me anything about it other than that priority waitlist forms are handled sequentially in the order that they are filled out. So I guess soon-to-be-graduated people weren't really given any leniency.\n\nBut really...14 graduate students got off the waitlist? Am I in the wrong for thinking this seems really low?

I never planned to be in GIH, I only opted in because they said they would swap with me if I got a GIH dorm. Turns out you can't swap to a non GIH dorm if you're GIH and vise versa. I had complications with self-assigning roommates and my self-assigning room time slot, so during that time this person self-assigned the dorm spot I meant to take. They will only switch if its in the same set of residence halls (Woodruff South and North). I already suggested that they opt into GIH and take the dorm I'm in instead (like manually swap) but they said they dont want to risk it. I'm just looking for possible solutions. I'm pretty sure all other North dorms are full, but I can't see the list of available rooms for some reason. Should I call housing and/or go in person? Do I need an appointment? Or will I just have to deal with it? Thank you!

I have people telling me that it's going to be so hard to into a master's program with my GPA and history, since I have an F on my transcript (I was trying out a minor and had a really really bad semester mental health wise, absolutely bombed that class). It's not related to my degree so I don't need it to graduate, but I couldn't retake it in the allowed academic year for grade replacement so I'm stuck with it, and also that class was of no use to me.\n\nApplying for work seems fruitless and pointless, I know so many internationals without internships and jobs that it makes me wonder if I'll ever make it. \n\nAnd I keep worrying my family and boyfriend about my future, I feel guilty that I'm causing so much stress to them too\n\nLooking for any advice that anyone can give me.

I was curious what the MBB recruiting presence is like there? I have a feeling the presence is great, but most people who get their MBA from GT are doing it for other kinds of industries (primarily engineering), so it skews the numbers a bit with most people not really being interested in consulting at a MBB. \n\n  \nJust a little bit of background, I currently have around 4 years of work experience post-grad, 1 year of that at a MBB in an operations/HR focused department, and the other 3 years at a top 5 financial institution in the U.S. where I work in Wealth Management. My undergrad is completely unrelated, but hopefully my time in the finance industry makes up for the "dream" undergrad I followed. My main goal is to end up back at a MBB firm as a consultant, plain and simple. Any guidance would be appreciated!\n\n  \nBonus points if you have any advice on trying to waive the GMAT based on my work experience. I’m studying for it in case I need to take it, but just curious if it would matter after 5 years of experience (when I’d be able to actually start at GT)	MBB Consulting Presence in MBA program?	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1e4366t/mbb_consulting_presence_in_mba_program/	/r/gatech/comments/1e4366t/mbb_consulting_presence_in_mba_program/	0	Discussion	0	28	1

1e19dne	No-Photograph1342	2024-07-12 05:06:31	5	36	Respectfully, I am so depressed after taking CS 6601 and CS 6795, both seemed interesting both were huge letdowns. The former was an absolute train-wreck, not only were we given unfair tests where a a quarter of our grade depended on a multi-step answer with no partial credit. But TAs and Instructors refused to correct (many, many) grading errors, stemming from incorrect grading keys, even after admitting their answers were incorrect or nonsensical. Bummer, I knew the class was hard but was excited to take the topic, I learned more in my internship and free online courses.\n\n6795 is bad in a different way, the material is solid and the class is enjoyable, but extremely luck based. I know a few friends that handed in way better material than me and sadly got lower grades. Grading is pretty vibes based it seems, and there is little to no communication from the teaching team. Bummer, I loved the material but midway through saw most of people I knew in the class stop caring, with the obviously broken grading system in place.\n\nGrades are not everything, take the classes if you want to learn the material but be warned, sometimes your grades will just be. As always, make sure you get something out of it other than your score, if it was me I would not recommend.

1dyte1v	jeremoi	2024-07-09 04:19:47	31	29	I'm transferring from a pretty small private university where the campus was significantly smaller than Gatech, so one of its perks was that I could pretty much walk from one end of campus to the other in no time. \n\nGiven Tech's size, I'm starting to think maybe I'm gonna need a set of wheels to get around campus. I used to skateboard and bmx a lot (I own a longboard and nickel board) but I've seen a lot of students get electric scooters and those one wheel thingies. Any reccomendations for best ways to get around campus? \n\nI'm also coming from far out of state, so something like a skateboard would be reasonable to bring but not a bike. I did see that there was a bike store on campus, does anyone have experience with that?

I’m at 126 credit hours and I’m graduating in 2026 (I’m a transfer student and came in with 60+ credit hours). I recently got my aid offer and it said that I’m “expected” to get fully covered for this school year. Which had me happy at first but then I got skeptical considering that HOPE caps at 127 attempted credit hours. Now I have two options, either I call the aid office tomorrow and confirm that I’m still getting my tuition fully covered. Option 2, act dumb as if I didn’t know and wait in August when they distribute the funds and find out I’m only getting $300 dollars from my “expected” full tuition coverage, therefore blame the FA office.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n	Running out of HOPE scholarship	gatech	link	\N	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dyn1a5	/r/gatech/comments/1dyn1a5/running_out_of_hope_scholarship/	0	Question	0	44	1

This year, I wrote a letter and completed my financial aid application as I've done for the past two years, but I got an email telling me I was ineligible for the aid I requested. There hasn't been any change in my financial situation, so I'm just wondering how these grants are allocated. I'm definitely not in a bad financial situation, and I know there are students with more need than me, but at the same time, I've been receiving these grants for the past four semesters and they've been a huge help.

However, due to some unfortunate circumstances, I am going to fail one of the classes. When GT gets my transcript from the CC, will that failed class affect my GPA at GT?  Or will I just not get any credit for the class? And will it show on the GT transcript that I failed that class? I heard that when applying for grad school they look at all of your transcripts, so I don't want this failed class to show since I will just retake an equivalent class at GT to make up for the credit.

I believe there may be things commuting students miss out on (both good and bad) so i wanted to ask others on campus.

1dpb49y	xcuys	2024-06-26 22:11:36	6	26	Hi, with the fall semester coming up very soon and assuming a lot of international students will join us soon, this post will serve as a guide to all the costs associated with leasing an apartment near GT. Even after 3 years here, the random charges everywhere surprises me every single time. Here is a summary of what I can recall from my experiences:\n\n**Section 1.1: Costs paid when applying for a lease:**\n\n1. Administrative fees (\\~$150-$250) -  Fees paid while applying for a lease, usually non-refundable. Yes, it costs more to apply to an apartment than GT itself.\n2. Application fees (\\~$75-$200/per lease applicant) - Fees paid while applying for a lease, usually refundable if your application is rejected.\n3. Scammy donations ($10-$50/per lease applicant)  - For people here, you might know who I'm referring to. Yes, there are mandatory donations to an organization you know nothing about.\n\n**Section 1.2: Costs paid just before the lease begins:**\n\n1. Georgia Power move-in deposit ($100-$250) - Move-in date set to lease start date, refunded after only 12 months being on their contract, doesn't matter if you move apartments.\n2. Cashier's check ($10) - Some apartments require you to pay the first month's rent (and other charges) with a cashier's check. Some banks allow 1 free cashier's check and some don't.\n3. Rental insurance ($175-$250 for 12 months) - rental insurance should be applied before the lease begins with the start date as the lease. It can be refunded if you move out before 12 months with some agencies.\n\n**Section 1.3: Costs paid on the first day of the lease:**\n\n1. Rent - pretty straightforward, explicitly mentioned during the lease application.\n2. Deposit - usually 1m-2m rent kept as deposit, should be paid on the first day of the lease. For people applying with guarantors, this may be different and I'm not sure about the costs related to it.\n3. Trash fees ($20-$40 per month) - Door service pickup for trash. Unreliable.\n4. Pest control fees ($2-$10 per month) - Yes. I still don't know why.\n5. Package concierge/LuxerOne/Fetch/etc/etc/etc ($10-$40 per month)- Package delivery fees, because some people try to steal your packages.\n\n**Section 1.4: Conservice fees**\n\nConservice is a billing service that will send you invoices for your water, trash, package, pest, and other charges along with rent. All the apartments that I have stayed in used this.\n\n1. Conservice account setup ($25 for the first month)\n2. Conservice service fee ($10-$15 every month)\n3. Conservice account closure fee ($25 for the last month)\n\nYep, as the name stands.\n\n**Section 1.5: Georgia Power**\n\nElectricity provider, highly reliable, and great customer service.\n\n1. Account establishment charge ($30 for the first month)\n2. Monthly usage charges - depends on # of people, usage, frugality. I stay in a 3 bedroom apartment with 3 people, and we are charged around $40-$80 per month per person. Depends on the weather, cooking, etc.\n\nI'm not sure if I have missed anything. Please make sure to actually calculate the rent including all utilities to get the real picture before applying for a lease. I hope this helps someone!

I am taking a summer course so I can graduate on time in the Fall and not have a MASSIVE course load in the Fall. But I am currently failing said summer class as I'm having trouble balancing it with my internship/job interviews. Im currently missing a deadline for my second HW assignment. How should I go about working this out with the professor? Should I talk to the Dean? \n\n  \nAlso I normally have accommodations for flexible deadlines but I haven't been in contact with ODS due to not hearing from them all last semester for said accommodations. \n\n  \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

1dndoi1	OITCommunicator	2024-06-24 13:37:13	32	29	The Office of Information Technology is upgrading security access to your Georgia Tech accounts!\n\nHere's what's up:\n\n1. Beginning this morning, June 24, we will begin implementing **Verified Duo Push** for all campus members. Verified Duo Push is a more secure version of Duo Push that provides additional security against “push fatigue" by requiring users to enter a three-digit code. You can learn more about it here: https://gatech.service-now.com/home?id=kb\\_article\\_view&sysparm\\_article=KB0043706.\n2. Also, beginning Tuesday June 25, campus members will be given the option to update their GlobalProtect VPN Client to the latest, preferred release when connected to [https://vpn.gatech.edu](https://vpn.gatech.edu/global-protect/login.esp). (This version includes bug fixes *and* provides security improvements.)\n\nYou can try the new GlobalProtect VPN release today by connecting to our test VPN portal https://test.vpn.gatech.edu. You can find instructions on adding the test portal here: https://b.gatech.edu/3pl8Iw0. (On July 23, all campus members who have not made the change will be upgraded automatically.)\n\nFeel free to let us know your thoughts here in this thread.

1dmq9pj	foreigntohome	2024-06-23 16:38:57	2	3	I have a starup idea that I've been thinking on for a year or two, but I felt like this coming fall was the best time to do it as I will only have one class; that way I can focus on it more without schoolwork stress. I have three bullet-point questions on whether taking Idea 2 Prototype (I2P) is a good fit given...\n\n1) My idea requires a lot of coding but I have no experience there other than understanding it (MATLAB). The idea is very app-coding and software engineering based, but I wouldn't be able to contribute enough on those parts to carry progress.\n\n2) I don't have a team. Given (1), I'll need a team that can do the coding part while I try to help out wherever I can. Given we're close to halfway through summer and I don't know how to recruit others for my idea, I'm worried that might be a significant deal-breaker to the people in charge of deciding on I2P applications.\n\n3) I'm on my last semester. I'm completely open to them taking the helm when I cannot, but I'd be hesitant about focusing solely on the startup after graduation. I don't deal well with high-stress situations well, so I don't want to make a major shift in leading/majorly contributing long-term unless I can come up with a good plan. I'm worried that this will make it harder to recruit team members if that's the case.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, recommendations, etc. on this, I would greatly appreciate any help I can get. I unfortunately don't feel comfortable putting my idea out on the internet, but I can try being more specific in a comment reply if it helps	Advice on taking I2P on last semester with no coding experience	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1dmq9pj/advice_on_taking_i2p_on_last_semester_with_no/	/r/gatech/comments/1dmq9pj/advice_on_taking_i2p_on_last_semester_with_no/	0	Question	0	19	1

I’ve had some troubles with the housing application portal and ended up needed to pay the $80 deposit twice to get through to the rest of the application.\n\nI’ll spare the details but basically it was a lot of help desk tickets being filed and a lot of calls all resulting in “wait longer for the payment to process” in the span of the past 4 days before I finally decided to repay the deposit (I originally paid it June 15th and just repaid it this morning). Now there is a waitlist for housing and I am $160 down the drain. \n\nI called the help desk this morning (they were doing training so I left a message) and submitted another ticket through the housing help desk (probably won’t get a response since I’ve only gotten one response  in the past 4 days of tickets submitted).

I wanted to get a checkup and speak to a doctor with some questions I had about my health. I'm interning in Atlanta and staying in my apartment near Tech so Stamps is the most convenient location from an access perspective. I know you pay for the health fee while you are enrolled as a student, but I'm not taking summer classes, though I am enrolled for the fall. Would I be able to get a checkup now and basically have the bill covered by the health fee I pay in the fall, or should I just find a walk-in clinic type deal to go to instead? I am not from Georgia, so I don't really have a primary care provider in the state and these are realistically my only options. Any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks!

Do any of you have study material/study tips for it? What are the Python (or any other language) concepts we need to know for it?

I’m trying to GTA for the same class and a professor I’ve already TAed for. I’ve reached out to so many people (Professor, advisor, undergrad TA head), and I still don’t know if I’ll be GTAing the class in the fall. No one has an answer. The professor said ‘experienced TAs will get a priority but I can’t guarantee anything and it’s up to the TA-matching system’. And my advisor tells me to reach out to him, while the prof tells me otherwise. \n\nI just really need to know if my Masters will be funded or not. Because if not, I plan on not doing it.  \n\nCan anyone give me some advice on how to figure this out and lemme know when they got their offers?\n	When will I get a GTA confirmation for Fall 2024?	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1dgqpwb/when_will_i_get_a_gta_confirmation_for_fall_2024/	/r/gatech/comments/1dgqpwb/when_will_i_get_a_gta_confirmation_for_fall_2024/	0	Discussion	0	0	0

I tried to talk to them but I got ghosted for the entire month and didn't receive a response, nor a letter grade deduction so I didn't really know what was going on. I didn't even know whether or not it was even gonna change. I thought maybe they finally understood what happened and just didn't answer me?\n\nHowever, this past Monday, 4 days before GT released the transfer decisions, I got an email saying that my transcript was updated and I received a letter grade deduction. I didn't tell GT because I was worried about my decision being delayed because of this when I still meet the requirements anyway.\n\nGT requires another transcript to be sent upon acceptance because I was signed up for Fall 2024 classes at my previous institution. My old transcript has a B for that class while my new transcript will show a C. I'm wondering what could happen when I send my new transcript. I was thinking of just sending it without saying anything and only explaining if they asked, but I'm worried that it might look like I'm trying to hide something when I'm not.\n\nI guess my real question is, is it possible that my acceptance gets revoked because of this?? I paid the deposit already.

Currently I go to a t30 school in the west coast pursuing a major I’m not passionate about, but I would be considering an instate student at tech. I want to study industrial design and have completed all the transfer requirements other than physics. I already spoke with admissions and they told me I could complete it in the fall while I submit my transfer application. I am not good at math or math based sciences, and at my school we have requirements based on different categories and I’ve already fulfilled the category that physics is in. I could still take physics even though I fulfilled the requirement but I’m hesitant because of my math ability and the chances I don’t get accepted. I was wondering if it would be easier for me to apply as an international affairs & modern language major then switch to ID once I get accepted. Or should I just take physics and apply ID?

There is patch of land (on westshire pl nw) with a flourishing ecosystem of massive trees, all kinds of animals (raccoons, possums, squirrels, etc.). I think some of those trees are atleast a 100 years old, considering their size.\n\nI see folks cutting down the trees for the past 2 days, and butchering the ecosystem. I understand that the land belongs to an individual and he/she has decided to do something with that land, but isn't there anything we can do to stop this?\n\nJust because those animals don't speak, doesn't give us the right to take their home away. I saw a kid raccoon lying dead on the road with the mother nearby. For the past 4 years I've been living here, and have come to appreciate the small ecosystem. I'm utterly disgusted by how something like this can be allowed to happen.\n\nThe question is: Is there anything we can do about this?

I understand that everyone has their own journey through college, and it’s not a one size fits all. Not everyone will graduate in four years, and it’s a matter of taking the needed time off to come back stinger and in a better mindset, but I just can’t come to terms with it. My plan was to finish it in four, yet here I am. I guess a part of me feels guilty for it, and the other part is having a hard time.

1d4zqo9	penguinothepenguin	2024-05-31 16:28:28	10	47	Hi Jackets!  \n\n\nMe and some other Jackets came up with a new program called EurekaLink meant to connect labs with student researchers in a more effective manner.\n\n  \nLike many of you, we at EurekaLink know that finding research can be difficult. Scrolling to 100s of lab websites to see which ones to send an email to. Then waiting a week until you realize that they aren't slow at checking their email they just ghosted you. Ultimately you end up just joining a lab that your friend was in or a professor you took a class under regardless of if you actually like the lab.  \n\n\nAt EurekaLink we want to make applying to research easier and more equitable. We do this by partnering with professors and labs to host research positions on our platform. Then we go through the profiles of all candidates on our platform and send candidates who we feel would be good fits for the positions (fit is determined on estimated passion not on credentials) and send them instructions on how to apply to the position.   \n\n\nSo what is so special about EurekaLink? We make it so that students don't have to actively look for research positions. By signing up for EurekaLink, anytime we feel there is a good fit for you, we'll send to your **inbox** the opportunity and then you can apply. This way you can be exposed to more unique research opportunities that fit your interests better, and not have to worry about if the lab will actually hire you.  \n\n\n**We have positions for all types of students from high schoolers, undergraduates, graduate to even post-doc roles**. **So if you're at all interested in research join EurekaLink!**\n\nAfter all you can always choose not to apply to the position :)  \n\n\nIf you're interested in participating in our pilot program fill this form out: [https://eurekalink.fillout.com/student\\_pilot](https://eurekalink.fillout.com/student_pilot)  \nIf you are a researcher who is looking to recruit students consider filling this form out to participate in our pilot program: [https://eurekalink.fillout.com/pilot](https://eurekalink.fillout.com/pilot)  \n\n\nIf you have any questions or would want to share stories about your research experience feel free to drop it below!

I want to balance the workload if possible. (Also, other than CS6290, none of the required electives are available this semester so they are out of the question.

I know I'd have to cover all the required classes, but is this possible to change your specialization at any moment? or Not allowed if certain threshold number of classes are completed in a specialization?  \n\n\nAsking because I want to take up additional classes but don't want to be kicked out once I complete my own spec.

1cyyh4l	K0Ke_Kitty	2024-05-23 17:28:41	49	36	Hey, y'all!\n\nI am currently a computer science major at GT and will be starting my second year in fall 2024. I need y'alls input/ideas. It would be great if alumni could pitch in.\n\nI have become a little stressed. I am enjoying my CS classes (have done CS1331, CS2050, CS1301) and I have done very well in them. However, I am worried about the future in terms of jobs because almost everyone I talk to outside of GT says they are going into CS and to be honest, I don't believe in the fact that I will get a job after graduation. I have been trying to do projects but I don't know if they are good or what I should be doing to increase my chances. I am also certainly not the smartest in the CS major bunch. \n\nIt seems industrial engineering is interesting, though, and I could minor in CS while doing IE. IE also seems to be a more sure/stable career in the future for me since it can be in any industry. Also, GT is number one in it!\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Should I stick it out with CS, see where it goes, or should I change to IE and minor in CS?\n\nI know this is probably the usual anxious GT student post but any help or input is greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!

1cy8987	Kindly_Bag_914	2024-05-22 18:59:09	15	9	So I'm taking three classes this summer semester (two of them in progress currently) and they are all asynchronous. All of these classes are humanities courses, but since I need two humanities courses to fulfill the requirements (im a CS major), the other class will count as a free elective. The first class I'm doing well in, but the second class I didn't do so well on the first test (I can still get an A but i'm unsure). I wanted to post this to get some advice on the options I have:\n\n1. Continue taking all three classes and risk getting a B.\n2. Withdraw the second course (never withdrawed before and I saw that the calendar says the deadline is 5/31/2024 for this specific course) and continue with the other two classes. (I would fulfill my humanities requirements since its not language credits).\n\nI'm leaning more towards the second option since the tuition is free for the summer semester (covered by zell) and I don't tank my GPA with a B. However, I don't know how a W on the transcript would look like and how this would affect my GPA. Also, the second test is after the withdraw deadline as well.\n\nupdate: i decided to do pass/fail for this course. thanks for the advice y'all, much appreciated	withdraw class for summer semester?	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1cy8987/withdraw_class_for_summer_semester/	/r/gatech/comments/1cy8987/withdraw_class_for_summer_semester/	0	Question	0	0	0

1dpcvji	LysanderStarr	2024-06-26 23:30:22	19	85	**Tl,Dr:** **Title**\n\nToday, GT Cyber sends everyone an email (see below) saying, that we've been hacked and employees had their paychecks stolen.  In the same email, they point out that Georgia Tech is not taking any responsibility going forward and employees are just SOL if they have their check stolen.  As an aside, this is strange coming from the Cyber Security team and not HR/Payroll, or perhaps the EVP A&F.  Instead, faceless Cyber Security sends the email.  \n\nWhat is frustrating is that I happen to know that these attacks have been going on for several months and that Cyber has known about the losses, but only today sent this email.  Further, they did nothing to proactively identify employees in May who had suspicious activity with their direct deposit before payroll hit May 30.  They only found them after the May 30 payroll when employees had checks bouncing.  But they could have identified the suspicious activity before payroll hit and then directed the compromised employees to change their passwords and fix their direct deposit information.\n\nSince then their best solution is just to tell you that you're just screwed and add some digits on Duo.  I get it if you're careless enough to fall for phishing, but I do NOT trust GT Cyber Security with securing the payroll systems.  As such, how is the Institute going to determine if a payroll loss is because of carelessness on the employee or a system-wide breach?  A logical person would think, "surely, they won't trust the same team that couldn't find and alert the compromised accounts before the June 1 payroll that lost their checks."  Oh but they will.  Why you ask?  **Because they just made the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), responsible for that dumpster fire of a department** [the permanent Chief Information Officer (CIO)](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2024/06/25/leo-howell-named-vice-president-information-technology-and-chief-information)**.**  \n\nThat's right.  That's the same CISO who is under [federal investigation](https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/D4E1FAQHUNesD1jvoHQ/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1709417679808?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=LkbSUvYVpmf8yCnRtfvIujqxINHBRGH5bxWlcocjw2I) for violations of the False Claims Act for falsifying federal grant applications related to cyber protections.  \n\nI've been an employee at Tech for a long time, a GT student before that and love this place, but I'm really becoming jaded.  The lack of leadership from Angel is discouraging.  Many of his hires have been duds, including the new EVP for A&F, who was responsible for making this CISO the new CIO.  \n\nGod help us.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n>Dear Georgia Tech Community,\n\n>As the end of the month approaches, we wanted to contact you once again regarding recent direct deposit fraud activity.\n\n>Over the last two months, we have seen an increased number of cybersecurity attacks on University System of Georgia (USG) employees, including a small number of individuals at Georgia Tech, through payroll direct deposits. These attempts included cybercriminals using phishing emails and Duo two-factor authentication push scams on mobile devices to gain access to an employee’s credentials, allowing them to make changes to direct deposit/banking information and resulting in financial loss for the employee. Affected employees have been contacted, their accounts secured, and they have been reimbursed if their payroll was impacted. ***Please note that*** ***if your pay is misdirected to a fraudulent account, you will need to report the theft to law enforcement. Additionally, as with other institutions within the USG, if the loss is due to action or inaction on the employee’s part, Georgia Tech cannot pay a second time.***\n\n>Georgia Tech is taking steps to strengthen its security against attacks through heightened monitoring and the recent implementation of [~Duo Verified Push~](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2024/06/21/verified-duo-push-launching-tech-june-24) across the Institute. However, we advise you to remain extremely vigilant and know how to remain protected.\n\n>If you receive a push notification from Duo and have not attempted any recent logins, this means that your password has already been compromised. Please deny the alert and immediately change your password via Passport at [~passport.gatech.edu~](https://passport.gatech.edu/).\n\n>Please review your personal information and all components of your pay (e.g., benefit deductions, retirement deductions, direct deposit information, etc.) for each pay period through [~OneUSG Connect Self-Service.~](https://oneusgconnect.usg.edu/)  \n\n>Always report suspicious emails by forwarding them to [~phishing@gatech.edu~](mailto:phishing@gatech.edu). Be on alert for any emails asking you to take urgent action, have incorrect spelling or grammar, or come from an unknown email address. Do not engage with suspicious emails by replying to the sender, open attachments, click on links in the email, or forward it to others.\n\n>Do not click on links embedded in the body of an email to validate your credentials within OneUSG Connect or your network credentials at Georgia Tech.

1cwsigp	BiznessTech	2024-05-20 22:34:48	24	42	Hey everyone, I was admitted as a business major this year, but as I’ve learned more about Georgia Tech, I’ve heard about how great the IE program is here. With the major confirmation deadline 5/22, I’ve been stuck for a while now on whether or not I should switch into Industrial Engineering. As a business major, I’d definitely choose the Strategy & Innovation concentration since I’m more focused on management and leading a business. However, I keep hearing that an IE degree is more desirable to potential employers as it is a STEM degree from one of the most respected STEM schools in the nation. But I’m wondering if majoring in Industrial Engineering holds me back from some of the traditional opportunities you would receive at a business school since the courses seem to be focused on the technicals of a business. I also like the smaller class sizes and lots of resources that Scheller has, while I don’t know about the sizes of IE classes. I’m also wondering if a business degree from a school like Georgia Tech causes employers to hesitate. I know that the business school is highly ranked, but I say this because some people I’ve talked to have asked me why I’m majoring in business at Georgia Tech with a negative connotation. If anyone could help answer my questions and speak to both programs just in general that would be greatly appreciated, thanks.\n\nEDIT: I’m now an Industrial Engineer, thanks everyone for your feedback, it certainly helped with my decision.

I was lucky enough to get an internship for the summer and also get into the ibm accelerate program. However, I do know that I lack skills when it comes to building cool projects with code which is a skill I want to really hone in on because it’s good for internship and because I just genuinely want to build cool stuff with code.  Specifically, I want to deviate from just using Java(the class I took to learn data structures) and learn machine learning so I can build some cool projects using different types or learning. However, I don't have much Python experience. Whats steps can I take right now so that eventually I can build cool ml projects in the coming future. Also to prep for the upcoming cycle I will be LeetCoding and follow the 3 month hackerrank rubric (do you guys recommend both ?). Thanks again for all your time.

1emf3nd	Shiranara	2024-08-07 15:41:11	102	211	So I went back to visit my family in China after the Summer semester is over, and I got to experience the public  transportation system in my hometown again.\n\nJust for reference, HangZhou Metro, with total rail length of **516 km** (320 miles) is serving the metro area of HangZhou, which spans over about 16850 square km (6506 square miles). While MARTA, with total rail length of **77 km** (48 miles), as its name suggests, should serve metro Atlanta, whose area is 21694 square km (8376 square miles).\n\nI know it's just difficult for GA gov to expand the MARTA lines with limited funding, and all those counties holding different opinions. But it just gets a bit annoying throwing back to all those mornings/evenings stuck on I85. 75, 400, and those days that I have to pay 30$+ for Ubers to go literally everywhere after my car got rear-ended by some maniac driver near Chamblee-Tucker Rd Exit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wk8yy65ji9hd1.jpg?width=3472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a80c551d36ef371f36bb36fe534a7c225d2ecc01\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wppv975ji9hd1.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bcf57e78834169f16e821e02a07962b576593fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8j0775ji9hd1.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a66d496b763c115766987ce3ff030ab9cd4039e8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/755ywa5ji9hd1.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=897e3b5b60b7e2297e63402fc1c4a5c864a4ef5f\n\n	If only Atlanta have transit system like this	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1emf3nd/if_only_atlanta_have_transit_system_like_this/	/r/gatech/comments/1emf3nd/if_only_atlanta_have_transit_system_like_this/	0	Rant	0	-100	-1

1cvzpfr	CD-theNewYeee	2024-05-19 22:04:53	4	1	Hey all, I am a master's student choosing between a 4B4B apartment at SQ5 for 1375 per month (including everything) and a 4B2B on at 100 Midtown for 1140 a month. My concern is that 100 Midtown is so cheap but I will need to sublet for the summer next year. If you live at 100 Midtown, have you been able to sublet a bedroom and if so, what price does it usually fetch? I am worried that the shared bath thing will make it difficult for me to find someone willing to take it over the summer and if I cannot sublease, I might as well get SQ5 since its much easier to find someone who would sublease (even at a loss) for that. Thanks.

I applied for the honors program LLC but got accepted into Global Leadership instead.

1cssivi	minecraftmite	2024-05-15 18:49:07	43	77	I loved computer science throughout high school. I worked on dozens of personal projects, mostly centered around web design and cybersecurity, and, even after coming to GT, I still entered and won hackathons during my first semester and generally liked CS as a whole. \n\nAfter two semesters of majoring in CS at GT, I absolutely hate it. Our classes are so painfully non-project based, and it’s so hard for me to learn theoretical concepts. I got Cs in both CS1331 and CS1332, barely passing the latter. It’s a mix of me genuinely hating the material, making it so difficult to learn, and me disliking the isolating environment at GT as a whole (a whole different story). \n\nI’ve now just finished my first year, and my GPA sits at a 3.0. I do have a summer software internship (not top-tier, but legit and respectable), but I’m dreading it. I had to drop out of every club and project, because even after months, I still couldn’t grasp the technical concepts I needed to understand. I’m so scared that my internship will be the same. \n\nIt’s too late to switch (I wouldn’t graduate on time, and I don’t have money to not), and I don’t know what I would switch to even if I could. \n\nI know this sounds very first-world and embarrassing. I just feel like I’ve watched the passionate and talented high school version of me fade away, and I don’t think I’m cut out for the CS “real world”. I don’t know what to do.

I'm now stuck with taking 18 credits one of my last two semesters, so I'm hoping someone can help me out with finding a really good, easy professor. I took ID2242 last semester with 17 credits and it was perfect. Does anyone know a social science class that will be a similar time commitment so I can crank my last few hours out and get out of here on time 😭\n\nI'm also planning on taking it pass/fail, so it will be easier, but I would still like some suggestions for good professors so I don't get screwed. Thanks guys!!

1cqyoe1	AlternativeSwimming2	2024-05-13 12:58:23	5	14	I attended multiple BSMS info sessions and the advisors have been encouraging students to apply early. They said it's ok even if you're a sophomore/junior and that you could get the acceptance letter early to secure the admission.\n\nIt was like they tipped students to apply when the GPA is high so that we have a higher chance\n\nHowever, when I went into the application portal, I had to choose the entering term for the BSMS program, and my anticipated undergrad graduation/masters entry term is not listed there yet (I'm junior standing by credit hours for context)\n\nWas anyone able to apply to BSMS early? If so, how early was it & how long did it take to hearback?

My budget doesn't allow me to buy a new windows laptop just for one project. What places on campus can we get access to windows PCs (not monitors, and not iMacs!) for student usage, preferably with a GPU? (without is also fine though). Library and CULC have monitors only.\n\nEdit: I am getting a lot of suggestions for VMs and other resources, but honestly now I am questioning why a university like GT (known for its CS program) doesn't really have PCs where students can work on lol	Computers for Student Usage at GT	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1cs01jh/computers_for_student_usage_at_gt/	/r/gatech/comments/1cs01jh/computers_for_student_usage_at_gt/	0	Question	0	0	0

1eo15aa	Environmental_Sun_76	2024-08-09 14:29:05	1	7	I haven't found much discussion about this MS in CS specialization. If you've taken it, or know anything about it, what is your opinion on it? Favorite classes? I've heard from one person it isn't too different from the ML option, and that unfortunately there is not really an emphasis on hardware. I've also seen a lot of the classes being limited to OMSCS, which i thought was a bit strange.\n\nFor context, I'm a BSMS student, starting MS this Fall. I really enjoyed CS 3651 (prototyping intelligent devices) during my undergrad, and was hoping this specialization might help me go further down that direction and also with ML.

My problem is I'll only receive my full financial aid if I am full time. So I wanted to ask - do most BSMS students tend to take a full time load of 12 credit hours each semester, or do most take 9?

I know Invisalign can be expensive and I've saved up money but I'm trying to understand if there are any insurance plans that can cover a certain amount for me. \n\nI'm also looking for suggestions and recommendations on doctors and clinics that can do the procedure for me. \n\nI read about MetLife but that seems to be only for federal employees. I'm looking at other options but it's all a little confusing.

1csyjan	Aggressive-Plan-7869	2024-05-15 23:07:14	3	3	I'll be in Atlanta this summer, but I won't be living on campus or taking classes, though I will be an on-campus student in the fall. Does anyone know if I'll still be able to access my mailbox in the Student Center over the summer? Additionally, will I still get emails when I receive a package or mail? I just don't want to have to rent a PO box if I don't have to. I know this has been asked before, but it's been a little while so I just wanted to make sure nothing changed, since I can't find anything about this on the student mail website.

1csuz77	TurbodToilet	2024-05-15 20:30:51	13	25	The summer fluids course is now requiring in person proctoring for the exams. While I can understand why, this really just became an inconvenience especially because I’m working full time at my internship. They’re even saying we have to pay out of our own pocket to cover the in person proctoring if we use a 3rd party instead of coming to campus to take the exam. I feel like they should have disclosed this from the beginning somehow? \n\nThis is my first summer course so maybe they’ve been doing this recently for all classes? Last I’ve heard from a friend his exams for fluids in the summer were on the traditional honor lock proctoring. \n\nAny recommendations for exam proctoring companies or schools that aren’t too pricy? \n\n	QUP (Fully at distance class) in person proctoring	gatech	text	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1csuz77/qup_fully_at_distance_class_in_person_proctoring/	/r/gatech/comments/1csuz77/qup_fully_at_distance_class_in_person_proctoring/	-1	Discussion	-44	0	0
