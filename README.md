People think that Georgia Tech is a great place. And it is indeed! However, nobody talks about the dark side of GT... Depression, anxiety, dining halls. Nobody except Reddit! That's why we create a sentiment analysis web application, or simply put - a campus-wide mood-meter. Our app uses **sophisticated** techniques and analyzes the mood on campus. 

This is a great way to relate and see that you're not alone with your struggles. Buzz also has sometimes hard times...
